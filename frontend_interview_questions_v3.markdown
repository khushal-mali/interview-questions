## Initial Screening Round

### Behavioral Questions

1. **Tell us about a time you had to adapt to a significant change in a project’s requirements. How did you handle it?**

   **Answer**: In a recent project, the client changed the design system mid-development, requiring a switch from Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS. I quickly studied Tailwind’s documentation, experimented with its utility classes, and updated the codebase incrementally while maintaining deadlines. I also trained the team on Tailwind’s basics, ensuring a smooth transition. The project was delivered successfully, enhancing my adaptability and teamwork skills.

2. **Describe a situation where you went above and beyond to deliver a project.**

   **Answer**: On a tight-deadline e-commerce project, I noticed the checkout flow lacked accessibility features. Beyond the requirements, I implemented ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation, tested with screen readers, and documented the changes. This improved usability for all users, earning positive client feedback and reinforcing my commitment to inclusive design.

3. **Can you share an experience where you resolved a conflict within your team?**

   **Answer**: During a sprint, a designer and I disagreed on a UI component’s styling. I organized a meeting to discuss our perspectives, focusing on user experience goals. We prototyped both approaches in Figma, tested with users, and chose the option with better feedback. This collaborative approach resolved the conflict and strengthened our team’s communication.

### Situational Questions

4. **How would you respond if a stakeholder insists on a feature that negatively impacts performance?**

   **Answer**: I’d explain the performance trade-offs using data, such as Lighthouse scores, and propose alternatives that meet their goals without compromising speed. For example, if they want a heavy animation, I’d suggest a lighter CSS-based solution. I’d also offer to prototype both options for comparison, ensuring a data-driven decision that aligns with project priorities.

5. **What steps would you take if a website you built fails WCAG accessibility guidelines?**

   **Answer**: I’d audit the site using tools like WAVE or axe, identifying issues like missing ARIA labels or low contrast. I’d prioritize fixes based on impact, such as adding `alt` text or adjusting colors, and retest with screen readers like NVDA. I’d also document accessibility best practices for the team to prevent future issues, ensuring compliance and inclusivity.

## Technical Round

### HTML Questions

6. **What are the benefits of using HTML5 semantic elements over non-semantic ones?**

   **Answer**: Semantic elements like `<article>`, `<nav>`, and `<aside>` describe content meaning, improving accessibility for screen readers, enhancing SEO by aiding search engine indexing, and making code more readable for developers. Non-semantic elements like `<div>` lack inherent meaning, requiring extra attributes for clarity. Example: `<nav>` clearly denotes navigation.

7. **Explain the role of the `<meta charset="UTF-8">` tag.**

   **Answer**: The `<meta charset="UTF-8">` tag specifies the character encoding for the HTML document, ensuring proper rendering of text, including special characters. UTF-8 supports a wide range of characters, making it ideal for internationalization. It should be placed early in the `<head>` to prevent parsing issues.

8. **What is the `contenteditable` attribute, and how is it used?**

   **Answer**: The `contenteditable` attribute allows users to edit an element’s content directly in the browser. Example:
   ```html
   <div contenteditable="true">Edit me!</div>
   ```
   It’s used for rich text editors or interactive forms but requires JavaScript to save changes and careful sanitization to prevent security risks like XSS.

9. **What is the difference between the `<link>` and `<style>` tags?**

   **Answer**: `<link>` references an external CSS file (e.g., `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`), promoting reusability and caching. `<style>` defines inline CSS within the HTML document (e.g., `<style>body { color: blue; }</style>`), suitable for small styles or critical CSS. Use `<link>` for maintainability and `<style>` for quick prototyping.

10. **What is the `loading` attribute for images and iframes?**

    **Answer**: The `loading` attribute controls resource loading behavior. Values include:
    - `lazy`: Defers loading until the element is near the viewport.
    - `eager`: Loads immediately (default).
    Example: `<img src="image.jpg" loading="lazy">` reduces initial page load time, improving performance for off-screen images.

### CSS Questions

11. **What is the difference between `rem` and `em` units in CSS?**

    **Answer**: 
    - `rem`: Relative to the root (`<html>`) font size (e.g., `1rem = 16px` if root is `16px`).
    - `em`: Relative to the parent element’s font size, leading to compounding effects.
    Example: If `html { font-size: 16px; }` and a parent has `font-size: 2em`, a child with `font-size: 1em` is `32px`, but `1rem` is always `16px`. Use `rem` for consistency and `em` for relative scaling.

12. **How does the CSS specificity hierarchy work?**

    **Answer**: Specificity determines which CSS rule applies when multiple rules target the same element. It’s calculated by:
    - Inline styles: 1,0,0,0
    - IDs: 0,1,0,0
    - Classes/attributes/pseudo-classes: 0,0,1,0
    - Elements/pseudo-elements: 0,0,0,1
    Example: `#id .class` (0,1,1,0) overrides `.class` (0,0,1,0). Use `!important` sparingly to override specificity.

13. **What is the purpose of the `calc()` function in CSS?**

    **Answer**: The `calc()` function performs mathematical calculations for CSS values, supporting addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Example:
    ```css
    width: calc(100% - 20px);
    ```
    It’s useful for responsive layouts and dynamic sizing, combining units like `%` and `px`.

14. **How do you create a sticky header using CSS?**

    **Answer**: Use `position: sticky` with a top offset. Example:
    ```css
    header {
      position: sticky;
      top: 0;
      background: white;
      z-index: 10;
    }
    ```
    This keeps the header fixed at the top of the viewport when scrolling, within its parent container.

15. **What are CSS transitions, and how do they differ from animations?**

    **Answer**: Transitions smoothly change property values over time when triggered (e.g., on `:hover`). Example:
    ```css
    div { transition: background-color 0.3s; }
    div:hover { background-color: blue; }
    ```
    Animations use `@keyframes` for complex, predefined sequences, running independently of triggers. Transitions are simpler; animations offer more control.

### JavaScript Questions

16. **What is the difference between `call`, `apply`, and `bind` in JavaScript?**

    **Answer**:
    - `call`: Invokes a function with a specified `this` and arguments individually (e.g., `fn.call(obj, arg1, arg2)`).
    - `apply`: Invokes a function with a specified `this` and arguments as an array (e.g., `fn.apply(obj, [arg1, arg2])`).
    - `bind`: Returns a new function with a fixed `this` and optional preset arguments (e.g., `const bound = fn.bind(obj)`).
    Example:
    ```javascript
    const obj = { name: 'Test' };
    function greet() { console.log(this.name); }
    greet.call(obj); // "Test"
    ```

17. **What is event bubbling, and how can it be stopped?**

    **Answer**: Event bubbling is when an event on an element propagates to its ancestors. Stop it using `event.stopPropagation()`. Example:
    ```javascript
    document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', (e) => {
      e.stopPropagation(); // Prevents parent handlers
      console.log('Button clicked');
    });
    ```
    Use carefully to avoid breaking expected event flows.

18. **What is the difference between `setTimeout` and `setInterval`?**

    **Answer**:
    - `setTimeout`: Executes a function once after a delay (e.g., `setTimeout(fn, 1000)`).
    - `setInterval`: Executes a function repeatedly at intervals (e.g., `setInterval(fn, 1000)`).
    Example:
    ```javascript
    setTimeout(() => console.log('Once'), 1000);
    setInterval(() => console.log('Repeated'), 1000);
    ```
    Clear with `clearTimeout` or `clearInterval`.

19. **What is a generator function, and how is it used?**

    **Answer**: A generator function (declared with `function*`) yields multiple values using `yield`, pausing execution. Example:
    ```javascript
    function* generator() {
      yield 1;
      yield 2;
    }
    const gen = generator();
    console.log(gen.next().value); // 1
    console.log(gen.next().value); // 2
    ```
    Generators are useful for asynchronous iteration or lazy evaluation.

20. **What is the difference between `forEach` and `map`?**

    **Answer**:
    - `forEach`: Iterates over an array, executing a function for each element, with no return value (e.g., `[1,2].forEach(x => console.log(x))`).
    - `map`: Creates a new array with transformed elements, preserving the original (e.g., `[1,2].map(x => x * 2)` → `[2,4]`).
    Use `forEach` for side effects and `map` for transformations.

## Framework-Specific Round

### React Questions

21. **What is the purpose of `useReducer` in React?**

    **Answer**: `useReducer` manages complex state logic in functional components, using a reducer function to handle state transitions based on actions. Example:
    ```javascript
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer((state, action) => {
      switch (action.type) {
        case 'increment': return { count: state.count + 1 };
        default: return state;
      }
    }, { count: 0 });
    ```
    It’s ideal for predictable state updates, like in forms or game logic.

22. **What is a higher-order component (HOC) in React?**

    **Answer**: An HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with enhanced functionality. Example:
    ```javascript
    function withLogger(WrappedComponent) {
      return function(props) {
        console.log('Props:', props);
        return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
      };
    }
    ```
    HOCs are used for cross-cutting concerns like logging or authentication.

23. **How do you optimize React component rendering?**

    **Answer**: Optimize rendering with:
    - `React.memo`: Prevents re-renders for unchanged props in functional components.
    - `useCallback`/`useMemo`: Memoizes functions or values to avoid unnecessary recalculations.
    - Keyed lists: Ensure efficient list updates.
    Example: `const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {}, [])`.

24. **What is the difference between `useState` and `useReducer`?**

    **Answer**:
    - `useState`: Manages simple state with a setter function (e.g., `setCount(count + 1)`).
    - `useReducer`: Handles complex state with a reducer function, dispatching actions for updates.
    Use `useState` for simple values and `useReducer` for interdependent state or complex logic.

25. **How does React handle forms differently from traditional HTML forms?**

    **Answer**: React uses controlled components, where form inputs are bound to state, enabling real-time updates and validation. Example:
    ```javascript
    const [value, setValue] = useState('');
    <input value={value} onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)} />
    ```
    Unlike HTML forms, React avoids direct DOM manipulation, ensuring predictable state management.

## Advanced Technical Round

### Performance and Optimization Questions

26. **How do you minimize re-renders in a React application?**

    **Answer**: Minimize re-renders by:
    - Using `React.memo` for pure components.
    - Memoizing callbacks with `useCallback` and values with `useMemo`.
    - Avoiding inline functions/objects in JSX.
    - Splitting large components into smaller ones.
    Example: `const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a), [a])`.

27. **What is lazy loading, and how is it implemented in web applications?**

    **Answer**: Lazy loading defers loading non-critical resources (e.g., images, scripts) until needed, improving initial load time. Implement with:
    - `<img loading="lazy">` for images.
    - Dynamic imports in JavaScript: `import('module').then(module => {...})`.
    - React’s `React.lazy` for components: `const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./Component'))`.

28. **How do you profile a web application’s performance?**

    **Answer**: Profile using:
    - **Chrome DevTools**: Analyze runtime with the Performance tab.
    - **Lighthouse**: Evaluate Web Vitals like LCP and CLS.
    - **React Profiler**: Identify slow components.
    Example: Use DevTools to record a session, identifying bottlenecks like long tasks.

29. **What is tree shaking, and how does it work?**

    **Answer**: Tree shaking eliminates unused code from JavaScript bundles during compilation, supported by tools like Webpack or Rollup. It relies on ES6 modules (`import`/`export`) to detect and remove dead code. Example: Importing only needed functions (`import { fn } from 'module'`) ensures unused exports are excluded.

30. **How do you handle large datasets in a web application?**

    **Answer**: Handle large datasets by:
    - **Virtualization**: Render only visible items (e.g., `react-window`).
    - **Pagination**: Load data in chunks.
    - **Debouncing/Throttling**: Limit frequent updates in search or filters.
    - **Web Workers**: Offload heavy computations.
    Example: Use `react-window` to render 10,000 rows efficiently.

### Coding Questions

31. **Write a function to reverse a string without using built-in methods.**

    **Answer**:
    ```javascript
    function reverseString(str) {
      let result = '';
      for (let i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        result += str[i];
      }
      return result;
    }
    console.log(reverseString('hello')); // "olleh"
    ```
    This iterates backward, building a new string.

32. **Write a function to throttle a function call.**

    **Answer**:
    ```javascript
    function throttle(fn, delay) {
      let lastCall = 0;
      return function (...args) {
        const now = Date.now();
        if (now - lastCall >= delay) {
          lastCall = now;
          fn(...args);
        }
      };
    }
    const log = throttle(() => console.log('Throttled'), 1000);
    log(); // Executes if 1s has passed since last call
    ```
    Throttling limits function calls to a fixed rate.

33. **What is the output of `[1, 2, 3].reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr)`?**

    **Answer**: The output is `6`, as `reduce` sums the array elements starting from the first element as the initial accumulator.

34. **What is the outcome of this code?**
    ```javascript
    let x = 10;
    function test() {
      let x = 20;
      console.log(x);
    }
    test();
    console.log(x);
    ```

    **Answer**: Outputs `20` then `10`. The inner `x` is block-scoped to `test`, so `test()` logs `20`. The outer `x` remains `10`.

35. **Write a function to find the first non-repeating character in a string.**

    **Answer**:
    ```javascript
    function firstNonRepeatingChar(str) {
      const charCount = {};
      for (let char of str) {
        charCount[char] = (charCount[char] || 0) + 1;
      }
      for (let char of str) {
        if (charCount[char] === 1) return char;
      }
      return null;
    }
    console.log(firstNonRepeatingChar('aabbc')); // "c"
    ```
    This counts character occurrences and returns the first with a count of 1.

### Cultural Fit and Industry Knowledge

36. **How do you approach code reviews as a reviewer or reviewee?**

    **Answer**: As a reviewer, I focus on clarity, performance, and best practices, offering constructive feedback with examples. As a reviewee, I welcome feedback, ask clarifying questions, and implement suggestions thoughtfully. For instance, I once improved a component’s performance after a review suggested memoization, enhancing my attention to optimization.

37. **What emerging front-end technologies are you excited about?**

    **Answer**: I’m excited about WebGPU for advanced graphics in browsers and the evolution of frameworks like Qwik for minimal JavaScript delivery. These technologies promise faster, more immersive web experiences, and I’m eager to explore their applications in real-world projects.

38. **How do you ensure alignment with a cross-functional team?**

    **Answer**: I maintain alignment through regular stand-ups, clear documentation, and tools like Slack or Jira. For example, I collaborated with backend and design teams on an API-driven app, using shared specs to ensure consistency. I also proactively clarify requirements to avoid misalignment.

39. **What’s a technical challenge you faced recently, and how did you overcome it?**

    **Answer**: I faced a challenge optimizing a React app with frequent re-renders. Using the React Profiler, I identified a component re-rendering unnecessarily due to prop changes. I applied `React.memo` and `useCallback`, reducing renders by 50%. This deepened my understanding of React’s rendering behavior.

40. **What makes you a good fit for our team?**

    **Answer**: My expertise in modern front-end tools like React and Tailwind, combined with my collaborative approach, aligns with your team’s focus on innovative, user-focused solutions.
