## Beginner Commands

These commands are essential for anyone starting with Git. They cover the basics of setting up a repository, tracking changes, and collaborating with others.

### git init
**Purpose**: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

**Details**: Creates a `.git` subdirectory containing all the metadata and version history for the repository. This is the first step to start tracking files with Git.

**Usage**:
```bash
git init
```

**Example**:
```bash
$ mkdir my-project
$ cd my-project
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/my-project/.git/
```
This creates a new Git repository in the `my-project` directory.

**Use Case**: Use `git init` when starting a new project that you want to version control locally.

---

### git clone
**Purpose**: Creates a copy of an existing Git repository from a remote source.

**Details**: Downloads the entire repository, including its history and branches, from a remote URL (e.g., GitHub, GitLab). The cloned repository is a fully functional local copy.

**Usage**:
```bash
git clone <repository-url> [directory]
```

**Example**:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git my-repo
Cloning into 'my-repo'...
```
This clones the repository into a folder named `my-repo`.

**Use Case**: Use `git clone` to start working on an existing project hosted on a platform like GitHub.

---

### git add
**Purpose**: Stages changes in the working directory for the next commit.

**Details**: Adds modified or new files to the staging area, preparing them to be committed. You can stage specific files or all changes.

**Usage**:
```bash
git add <file>
git add .
```

**Example**:
```bash
$ echo "Hello" > file.txt
$ git add file.txt
$ git add .
```
The first command stages `file.txt`, while `git add .` stages all changes in the current directory.

**Use Case**: Use `git add` to select which changes to include in your next commit.

---

### git commit
**Purpose**: Saves staged changes to the repository's history.

**Details**: Creates a new commit with a message describing the changes. Commits are snapshots of the project at a specific point in time.

**Usage**:
```bash
git commit -m "commit message"
```

**Example**:
```bash
$ git add file.txt
$ git commit -m "Add file.txt with initial content"
[main 1a2b3c4] Add file.txt with initial content
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

**Use Case**: Use `git commit` to save your changes permanently to the repository.

---

### git status
**Purpose**: Displays the current state of the working directory and staging area.

**Details**: Shows which files are modified, staged, or untracked, and the current branch.

**Usage**:
```bash
git status
```

**Example**:
```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  modified:   file.txt
Untracked files:
  newfile.txt
```

**Use Case**: Use `git status` to check the state of your repository before staging or committing.

---

### git push
**Purpose**: Uploads local commits to a remote repository.

**Details**: Pushes commits from your local branch to the corresponding branch on the remote repository (e.g., GitHub).

**Usage**:
```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

**Example**:
```bash
$ git push origin main
To https://github.com/user/repo.git
   1a2b3c4..5d6e7f8  main -> main
```

**Use Case**: Use `git push` to share your changes with others or back up your work to a remote repository.

---

### git pull
**Purpose**: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository into the current branch.

**Details**: Combines `git fetch` (downloads changes) and `git merge` (integrates them into your branch).

**Usage**:
```bash
git pull origin <branch-name>
```

**Example**:
```bash
$ git pull origin main
From https://github.com/user/repo
 * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD
Updating 1a2b3c4..5d6e7f8
Fast-forward
```

**Use Case**: Use `git pull` to update your local repository with the latest changes from the remote.

---

### git branch
**Purpose**: Manages branches in the repository.

**Details**: Lists all branches, creates new branches, or deletes branches. Branches allow parallel development.

**Usage**:
```bash
git branch                     # List all branches
git branch <branch-name>       # Create a new branch
git branch -d <branch-name>    # Delete a branch
```

**Example**:
```bash
$ git branch feature
$ git branch
  feature
* main
$ git branch -d feature
Deleted branch feature
```

**Use Case**: Use `git branch` to create feature branches for new development or to manage existing branches.

---

### git checkout
**Purpose**: Switches branches or restores files.

**Details**: Updates the working directory to match the specified branch or commit. Can also restore files to their previous state.

**Usage**:
```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
git checkout <commit-hash> -- <file>
```

**Example**:
```bash
$ git checkout feature
Switched to branch 'feature'
$ git checkout main -- file.txt
```

**Use Case**: Use `git checkout` to switch between branches or revert specific files to a previous state.

---

### git merge
**Purpose**: Combines changes from one branch into another.

**Details**: Integrates the history of one branch into the current branch, creating a merge commit if necessary.

**Usage**:
```bash
git merge <branch-name>
```

**Example**:
```bash
$ git checkout main
$ git merge feature
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
```

**Use Case**: Use `git merge` to incorporate changes from a feature branch into the main branch.

---

## Intermediate Commands

These commands build on the basics, offering more control over the repository and collaboration workflows.

### git log
**Purpose**: Displays the commit history.

**Details**: Shows a list of commits in reverse chronological order, including commit hash, author, date, and message.

**Usage**:
```bash
git log
git log --oneline
```

**Example**:
```bash
$ git log --oneline
5d6e7f8 Add new feature
1a2b3c4 Add file.txt with initial content
```

**Use Case**: Use `git log` to review the history of changes in the repository.

---

### git diff
**Purpose**: Shows differences between commits, branches, or the working directory.

**Details**: Highlights changes in files, useful for reviewing modifications before staging or committing.

**Usage**:
```bash
git diff
git diff <branch1> <branch2>
```

**Example**:
```bash
$ git diff
diff --git a/file.txt b/file.txt
index e69de29..d95f3ad 100644
--- a/file.txt
+++ b/file.txt
@@ -1 +1 @@
-Hello
+Hello, World!
```

**Use Case**: Use `git diff` to inspect changes before committing or to compare branches.

---

### git stash
**Purpose**: Temporarily saves uncommitted changes.

**Details**: Stores modified and staged changes in a stack, allowing you to switch branches or perform other tasks without committing.

**Usage**:
```bash
git stash
git stash pop
```

**Example**:
```bash
$ git stash
Saved working directory and index state WIP on main
$ git stash pop
```

**Use Case**: Use `git stash` when you need to pause your work and switch to another task.

---

### git remote
**Purpose**: Manages connections to remote repositories.

**Details**: Allows you to add, remove, or view remote repositories (e.g., on GitHub).

**Usage**:
```bash
git remote -v
git remote add <name> <url>
```

**Example**:
```bash
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)
```

**Use Case**: Use `git remote` to set up or manage connections to remote repositories.

---

### git fetch
**Purpose**: Downloads objects and refs from a remote repository without merging.

**Details**: Updates your local copy of the remote repository's state without affecting your working directory.

**Usage**:
```bash
git fetch origin
```

**Example**:
```bash
$ git fetch origin
remote: Enumerating objects: 5, done.
remote: Total 5 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
```

**Use Case**: Use `git fetch` to check for updates in the remote repository without merging them.

---

### git reset
**Purpose**: Resets the current branch to a specific state.

**Details**: Can unstage changes (`--soft`), discard changes in the working directory (`--hard`), or reset to a specific commit.

**Usage**:
```bash
git reset --soft <commit>
git reset --hard <commit>
```

**Example**:
```bash
$ git reset --soft HEAD^  # Undo the last commit but keep changes staged
$ git reset --hard HEAD^  # Undo the last commit and discard changes
```

**Use Case**: Use `git reset` to undo commits or changes when you need to backtrack.

---

### git revert
**Purpose**: Creates a new commit that undoes changes from a previous commit.

**Details**: Unlike `git reset`, it preserves the commit history, making it safer for shared repositories.

**Usage**:
```bash
git revert <commit>
```

**Example**:
```bash
$ git revert 5d6e7f8
[main 9f8e7d6] Revert "Add new feature"

**Usage**:
```bash
git rebase <branch>
```

**Example**:
```bash
$ git checkout feature
$ git rebase main
```

**Use Case**: Use `git rebase` to integrate changes from the main branch into a feature branch with a cleaner history.

---

## Advanced Commands

These commands are for experienced users who need fine-grained control over Git or are working with complex workflows.

### git cherry-pick
**Purpose**: Applies a specific commit from one branch to another.

**Details**: Copies a single commit to the current branch, useful for selectively applying changes.

**Usage**:
```bash

```

**Use Case**: Use `git rebase -i` to squash multiple commits into one or reorder commits for a cleaner history.

---

### git blame
**Purpose**: Shows who last modified each line of a file and in which commit.

**Details**: Useful for tracking the origin of specific lines of code.

**Usage**:
```bash
git blame <file>
```

**Example**:
```bash
$ git blame file.txt
1a2b3c4 (Alice 2023-10-01 10:00:00) Hello, World!
```

**Use Case**: Use `git blame` to investigate who made specific changes and why.

---

## Best Practices and Tips

1. **Commit Often, Commit Small**: Make small, focused commits with clear messages to make tracking changes easier.
2. **Use Meaningful Commit Messages**: Follow a format like `<type>(<scope>): <description>` (e.g., `feat(auth): add login endpoint`).
3. **Pull Before Pushing**: Always run `git pull` before pushing to avoid conflicts.
4. **Backup Before Rewriting History**: Commands like `git rebase` or `git filter-branch` can permanently alter history, so create a backup.
5. **Use Branches for Features**: Create feature branches to isolate changes and keep the main branch stable.
6. **Review Changes with `git diff`**: Always check your changes before staging or committing.
7. **Leverage `.gitignore`**: Use a `.gitignore` file to exclude files (e.g., build artifacts, secrets) from version control.
8. **Collaborate Safely**: Use `git revert` instead of `git reset` in shared repositories to avoid disrupting others.
