## Initial Screening Round

### Behavioral Questions

1. **Describe a time when you had to learn a new technology or framework quickly for a project. How did you approach it?**

   **Answer**: In a previous role, I needed to learn Vue.js for a client project within a week. I started with the official documentation, focusing on core concepts like components and reactivity. I built a small prototype to practice, used online resources like Vue Mastery, and collaborated with a colleague familiar with Vue. The project was delivered on time, and I gained confidence in adapting to new tools quickly.

2. **Tell us about a time you received critical feedback on your code. How did you handle it?**

   **Answer**: During a code review, a senior developer pointed out that my JavaScript function was inefficient due to nested loops. I appreciated the feedback, asked for clarification, and researched alternatives like using `Map` for better performance. I refactored the code, which improved runtime by 30%, and made it a practice to seek feedback proactively to enhance my skills.

3. **Can you share an experience where you improved a website’s user experience?**

   **Answer**: On an e-commerce project, users reported slow page navigation. I analyzed the issue using Lighthouse and found large images slowing load times. I implemented lazy loading with `loading="lazy"` and optimized images with WebP format, reducing load times by 40%. User feedback improved, and I learned the value of performance in UX.

### Situational Questions

4. **What would you do if a project deadline was approaching, but a critical bug was discovered?**

   **Answer**: I’d assess the bug’s severity and impact with the team. If critical, I’d prioritize fixing it, using debugging tools like Chrome DevTools to isolate the issue quickly. I’d communicate with stakeholders to adjust expectations or timelines if needed, ensuring transparency. Post-fix, I’d test thoroughly to prevent regression and document the issue to avoid future occurrences.

5. **How would you approach a disagreement with a back-end developer about an API integration?**

   **Answer**: I’d initiate a discussion to understand their perspective and explain my front-end requirements, focusing on user needs. If the API response structure was an issue, I’d propose a compromise, like a wrapper function to adapt data. Collaboration tools like Postman could help test solutions. This approach fosters mutual respect and ensures a functional integration.

## Technical Round

### HTML Questions

6. **What are data attributes, and how are they used?**

   **Answer**: Data attributes (`data-*`) store custom data on HTML elements, accessible via JavaScript or CSS. For example, `<div data-id="123">` can be accessed with `element.dataset.id`. They’re used for dynamic behavior, like filtering elements or storing metadata, without cluttering the DOM. Example:
   ```html
   <div data-role="admin">User</div>
   <script>
     console.log(document.querySelector('div').dataset.role); // "admin"
   </script>
   ```

7. **What is the difference between `<script>`, `<script async>`, and `<script defer>`?**

   **Answer**:
   - `<script>`: Blocks HTML parsing until the script is fetched and executed.
   - `<script async>`: Fetches asynchronously and executes immediately, potentially out of order.
   - `<script defer>`: Fetches asynchronously but executes in order after HTML parsing.
   Use `defer` for scripts requiring DOM access and `async` for independent scripts like analytics.

8. **What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute in images?**

   **Answer**: The `alt` attribute provides a text description for images, used by screen readers for accessibility and displayed if the image fails to load. It also aids SEO by describing image content. Example: `<img src="cat.jpg" alt="A fluffy cat">`.

9. **What are HTML5 Web Storage options, and how do they differ?**

   **Answer**: HTML5 offers `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`:
   - `localStorage`: Stores data (key-value pairs) with no expiration until explicitly cleared, up to 5-10 MB.
   - `sessionStorage`: Stores data for the session (tab), cleared when the tab closes.
   Example: `localStorage.setItem('key', 'value');`. Use `localStorage` for persistent data and `sessionStorage` for temporary state.

10. **What is the difference between `<section>` and `<div>`?**

    **Answer**: `<section>` is a semantic element indicating a thematic grouping of content, often with a heading, improving accessibility and SEO. `<div>` is a non-semantic, generic container for styling or scripting. Use `<section>` for meaningful content blocks and `<div>` for layout purposes.

### CSS Questions

11. **What are pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in CSS?**

    **Answer**:
    - **Pseudo-classes** (e.g., `:hover`, `:focus`) target elements based on state or position (e.g., `button:hover { background: blue; }`).
    - **Pseudo-elements** (e.g., `::before`, `::after`) style specific parts of an element, like adding content (e.g., `p::before { content: "★"; }`).
    Pseudo-classes describe behavior; pseudo-elements target virtual parts.

12. **How does the `z-index` property work?**

    **Answer**: The `z-index` property controls the stacking order of positioned elements (`position: absolute`, `relative`, or `fixed`). Higher `z-index` values place elements above lower ones. It only works on positioned elements and within the same stacking context. Example: `div { position: absolute; z-index: 10; }` places the div above elements with lower `z-index`.

13. **What is the difference between `relative`, `absolute`, and `fixed` positioning?**

    **Answer**:
    - `relative`: Positions relative to its normal position, keeping its space in the flow.
    - `absolute`: Positions relative to the nearest positioned ancestor, removed from the flow.
    - `fixed`: Positions relative to the viewport, stays in place during scrolling.
    Example: `position: absolute; top: 10px; left: 20px;` moves an element relative to its ancestor.

14. **What is a media query, and how is it used for responsive design?**

    **Answer**: A media query applies CSS rules based on device characteristics, like screen width. Example:
    ```css
    @media (max-width: 600px) {
      body { font-size: 16px; }
    }
    ```
    It’s used to adjust layouts, fonts, or styles for different devices, ensuring a responsive user experience.

15. **What is the purpose of CSS custom properties (variables)?**

    **Answer**: CSS custom properties (e.g., `--main-color: blue;`) allow reusable values, defined with `--` and accessed with `var()`. Example:
    ```css
    :root { --main-color: blue; }
    div { color: var(--main-color); }
    ```
    They simplify maintenance, enable dynamic theming, and reduce code duplication.

### JavaScript Questions

16. **What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?**

    **Answer**:
    - `null`: Represents an intentional absence of value, explicitly set (e.g., `let x = null;`).
    - `undefined`: Indicates a variable is declared but not assigned a value (e.g., `let x;`).
    Use `null` for deliberate empty values and check with `===` to avoid type coercion issues.

17. **What is the `this` keyword, and how does it behave in different contexts?**

    **Answer**: The `this` keyword refers to the context in which a function is called:
    - Global context: `window` (browser) or `global` (Node.js).
    - Object method: The object (e.g., `obj.method()` sets `this` to `obj`).
    - Arrow functions: Inherit `this` from the surrounding scope.
    Example:
    ```javascript
    const obj = {
      name: 'Test',
      fn: function() { console.log(this.name); }
    };
    obj.fn(); // "Test"
    ```

18. **What is the purpose of `async` and `await` in JavaScript?**

    **Answer**: `async` declares a function that returns a Promise, and `await` pauses execution until the Promise resolves. They simplify asynchronous code, replacing `.then()`. Example:
    ```javascript
    async function fetchData() {
      const response = await fetch('api/data');
      return response.json();
    }
    ```
    Use `try/catch` for error handling.

19. **What is a Promise, and how does it work?**

    **Answer**: A Promise represents a future value, with states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. It’s created with `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {})` and handled with `.then()` or `.catch()`. Example:
    ```javascript
    const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => resolve('Success'), 1000);
    });
    promise.then(result => console.log(result)); // "Success"
    ```
    Promises manage asynchronous operations like API calls.

20. **What is the difference between `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`?**

    **Answer**:
    - `map`: Transforms each array element, returning a new array (e.g., `[1,2].map(x => x * 2)` → `[2,4]`).
    - `filter`: Returns a new array with elements passing a test (e.g., `[1,2,3].filter(x => x > 1)` → `[2,3]`).
    - `reduce`: Reduces an array to a single value (e.g., `[1,2,3].reduce((sum, x) => sum + x, 0)` → `6`).
    Each creates a new array without mutating the original.

## Framework-Specific Round

### React Questions

21. **What is the purpose of `useEffect` in React?**

    **Answer**: `useEffect` handles side effects (e.g., data fetching, subscriptions) in functional components. It runs after render and can clean up with a return function. Example:
    ```javascript
    useEffect(() => {
      const timer = setInterval(() => console.log('Tick'), 1000);
      return () => clearInterval(timer); // Cleanup
    }, []); // Empty dependency array runs once
    ```

22. **What are controlled vs. uncontrolled components in React?**

    **Answer**:
    - **Controlled**: Form elements whose value is managed by React state (e.g., `<input value={state} onChange={e => setState(e.target.value)}>`).
    - **Uncontrolled**: Form elements managed by the DOM, accessed via refs (e.g., `<input ref={inputRef}>`).
    Controlled components are preferred for predictable state management.

23. **What is prop drilling, and how can it be avoided?**

    **Answer**: Prop drilling occurs when props are passed through multiple component layers to reach a deeply nested component. Avoid it using:
    - **Context API**: Share data globally.
    - **State management**: Use Redux or Zustand for centralized state.
    Example with Context:
    ```javascript
    const UserContext = React.createContext();
    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>
      <Child />
    </UserContext.Provider>
    ```

24. **What is the significance of keys in React lists?**

    **Answer**: Keys are unique identifiers for list items, helping React efficiently update the DOM by tracking elements. Without keys, React may re-render unnecessarily. Example:
    ```javascript
    {items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}
    ```
    Use stable, unique IDs, not indices, to avoid re-rendering issues.

25. **What is React Router, and how is it used?**

    **Answer**: React Router is a library for client-side routing in React apps. It uses components like `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, and `Link` to manage navigation. Example:
    ```javascript
    import { BrowserRouter, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
    function App() {
      return (
        <BrowserRouter>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
          <Route path="/" component={Home} />
        </BrowserRouter>
      );
    }
    ```
    It enables single-page app navigation without full page reloads.

## Advanced Technical Round

### Performance and Optimization Questions

26. **How do you reduce JavaScript bundle size in a front-end application?**

    **Answer**: Reduce bundle size by:
    - **Tree Shaking**: Remove unused code with tools like Webpack.
    - **Code Splitting**: Split code into smaller chunks using dynamic imports.
    - **Minification**: Use Terser or UglifyJS to compress code.
    - **External Libraries**: Use lightweight alternatives or CDNs.
    Example: `import('module').then(module => {...})` for code splitting.

27. **What is Critical Rendering Path, and how do you optimize it?**

    **Answer**: The Critical Rendering Path is the sequence of steps browsers take to render a page (HTML parsing, CSSOM, DOM, render tree, layout, paint). Optimize it by:
    - Minimizing CSS/JavaScript blocking resources.
    - Inlining critical CSS.
    - Deferring non-critical JavaScript with `defer` or `async`.
    This reduces time to first paint, improving perceived performance.

28. **How do you handle memory leaks in JavaScript applications?**

    **Answer**: Prevent memory leaks by:
    - Removing event listeners in cleanup (e.g., `removeEventListener` in `useEffect`).
    - Avoiding global variables or large object references.
    - Using tools like Chrome DevTools Memory panel to identify leaks.
    Example: Clear intervals in React:
    ```javascript
    useEffect(() => {
      const id = setInterval(() => {}, 1000);
      return () => clearInterval(id);
    }, []);
    ```

29. **What is Web Vitals, and why are they important?**

    **Answer**: Web Vitals are metrics (e.g., Largest Contentful Paint, First Input Delay, Cumulative Layout Shift) measuring user experience aspects like loading, interactivity, and visual stability. They’re important for SEO and user satisfaction. Optimize by reducing render-blocking resources and improving server response times.

30. **How do you optimize images for web performance?**

    **Answer**: Optimize images by:
    - Using modern formats like WebP or AVIF.
    - Compressing with tools like TinyPNG.
    - Implementing responsive images with `srcset` and `sizes`.
    - Lazy loading with `loading="lazy"`.
    Example: `<img src="small.jpg" srcset="large.jpg 1024w" sizes="50vw">`.

### Coding Questions

31. **Write a function to check if a string is a palindrome.**

    **Answer**:
    ```javascript
    function isPalindrome(str) {
      const clean = str.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, '');
      return clean === clean.split('').reverse().join('');
    }
    console.log(isPalindrome('A man, a plan, a canal: Panama')); // true
    ```
    This cleans the string, reverses it, and compares it to the original.

32. **Write a function to debounce a function call.**

    **Answer**:
    ```javascript
    function debounce(fn, delay) {
      let timeout;
      return function (...args) {
        clearTimeout(timeout);
        timeout = setTimeout(() => fn(...args), delay);
      };
    }
    const log = debounce(() => console.log('Called'), 1000);
    log(); // Executes after 1s if not called again
    ```
    Debouncing limits function execution frequency, useful for events like scrolling.

33. **What is the output of `[1, 2, 3].map(num => num * 2)`?**

    **Answer**: The output is `[2, 4, 6]`, as `map` transforms each element by multiplying it by 2.

34. **What is the outcome of this code?**
    ```javascript
    console.log(typeof null);
    console.log(typeof undefined);
    console.log(null == undefined);
    console.log(null === undefined);
    ```

    **Answer**:
    - `typeof null` → `"object"` (historical bug in JavaScript).
    - `typeof undefined` → `"undefined"`.
    - `null == undefined` → `true` (loose equality with coercion).
    - `null === undefined` → `false` (strict equality, different types).

35. **Write a function to flatten a nested array (e.g., `[1, [2, 3], [4, [5]]]` → `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`).**

    **Answer**:
    ```javascript
    function flatten(arr) {
      return arr.reduce((flat, item) => {
        return flat.concat(Array.isArray(item) ? flatten(item) : item);
      }, []);
    }
    console.log(flatten([1, [2, 3], [4, [5]]])); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```
    This recursively flattens nested arrays using `reduce`.
