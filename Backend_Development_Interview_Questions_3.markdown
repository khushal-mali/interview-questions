# 100 New Commonly Asked Backend Development Interview Questions with Detailed Explanations

## Programming Fundamentals

1. **What is the difference between a function and a method?**  
   **Explanation**: A function is a standalone block of code performing a task, while a method is a function tied to an object or class in object-oriented programming. In backend languages like Python or Java, methods often manipulate object state, e.g., `list.append()` vs. a standalone `calculate_sum()` function.

2. **What is polymorphism, and how is it implemented?**  
   **Explanation**: Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated via a common interface. In backend development, it’s implemented via method overriding (e.g., in Java inheritance) or interfaces (e.g., Python’s duck typing), enabling flexible, reusable code.

3. **Explain the concept of immutability in programming.**  
   **Explanation**: Immutability means an object’s state cannot change after creation (e.g., strings in Python). It simplifies concurrency and debugging in backend systems but may increase memory usage due to creating new objects for updates.

4. **What is a memory leak, and how can it be prevented?**  
   **Explanation**: A memory leak occurs when memory is allocated but not freed, causing resource exhaustion. In backend systems, prevent it by using garbage-collected languages, closing resources (e.g., database connections), and profiling with tools like Valgrind or Java’s VisualVM.

5. **What is the difference between shallow and deep copying?**  
   **Explanation**: Shallow copying duplicates an object’s top-level structure but shares nested objects, while deep copying duplicates everything recursively. In Python, use `copy.copy()` for shallow and `copy.deepcopy()` for deep, critical for handling complex data in backend APIs.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

6. **What is a disjoint set (union-find) data structure?**  
   **Explanation**: A disjoint set tracks elements partitioned into disjoint subsets, used for detecting cycles or grouping (e.g., Kruskal’s algorithm). Operations like union and find run in near O(1) with path compression, useful for backend graph-based problems.

7. **Explain the difference between a min-heap and a max-heap.**  
   **Explanation**: A min-heap ensures the parent is smaller than its children, used for retrieving the smallest element (e.g., priority queues). A max-heap ensures the parent is larger, used for tasks like finding the largest value. Both have O(log n) insert/remove.

8. **What is the Kadane’s algorithm, and when is it used?**  
   **Explanation**: Kadane’s algorithm finds the maximum subarray sum in O(n) time by tracking the maximum sum ending at each position. It’s used in backend systems for optimizing time-series data or financial calculations, like finding peak profit periods.

9. **What is the difference between a queue and a priority queue?**  
   **Explanation**: A queue follows FIFO (First-In-First-Out), while a priority queue orders elements by priority, not insertion order. Priority queues, implemented with heaps, are used in backend task scheduling (e.g., job queues) with O(log n) operations.

10. **How would you find the shortest path in a weighted graph?**  
    **Explanation**: Use Dijkstra’s algorithm for non-negative weights, with a priority queue for O((V + E) log V) time, or Bellman-Ford for negative weights (O(VE)). These are used in backend systems for routing or network optimization.

## Databases

11. **What is a composite key, and when is it used?**  
    **Explanation**: A composite key combines multiple columns to uniquely identify a record when a single column isn’t unique. It’s used in relational databases for tables like order details, where `order_id` and `product_id` together ensure uniqueness.

12. **What is a database cursor, and how is it used?**  
    **Explanation**: A cursor iterates over query results in chunks, reducing memory usage for large datasets. In backend systems, it’s used with ORMs or drivers (e.g., Python’s `psycopg2`) to process rows incrementally, especially for batch operations.

13. **What is the difference between OLTP and OLAP?**  
    **Explanation**: OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) handles frequent, small transactions (e.g., banking systems) with low latency. OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) processes complex queries for analytics (e.g., data warehouses). Backend systems choose based on use case.

14. **What is a database schema, and why is it important?**  
    **Explanation**: A schema defines the structure of a database (tables, columns, constraints). It ensures data consistency and integrity, guiding backend applications in querying and updating data correctly, especially in relational databases.

15. **What is a self-join, and when is it useful?**  
    **Explanation**: A self-join joins a table with itself, useful for hierarchical data (e.g., employee-manager relationships). In SQL, alias the table differently to compare rows, e.g., `SELECT e1.name, e2.name FROM employees e1 JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.id`.

## APIs and Web Services

16. **What is a webhook vs. an API poll?**  
    **Explanation**: A webhook pushes data to a URL on an event, enabling real-time updates (e.g., payment confirmations). API polling involves periodic requests to check for updates, less efficient but simpler. Webhooks are preferred in backend systems for efficiency.

17. **What is the purpose of an API mock server?**  
    **Explanation**: A mock server simulates API responses for testing or development, decoupling frontend and backend work. Tools like Postman or WireMock help backend developers test endpoints without relying on live services.

18. **What is the difference between PUT and PATCH in REST APIs?**  
    **Explanation**: PUT replaces an entire resource with new data, requiring a full payload. PATCH updates specific fields, using partial payloads. Both are idempotent, but PATCH is more efficient for partial updates in backend APIs.

19. **What is API authentication vs. API authorization?**  
    **Explanation**: Authentication verifies the identity of a client (e.g., via API keys or OAuth). Authorization determines what actions the client can perform (e.g., read-only access). Both are critical for securing backend APIs.

20. **What is the role of a request idempotency key?**  
    **Explanation**: An idempotency key ensures that repeated API requests (e.g., due to retries) produce the same result without side effects, like duplicate charges. Backend systems store keys in a database to track processed requests.

## System Design

21. **How would you design a logging system for a distributed application?**  
    **Explanation**: Use a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK Stack) with agents collecting logs from services, a message queue for transport, and a database for storage. Ensure scalability with sharding and searchability with indexing.
