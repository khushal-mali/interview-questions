## Advanced SQL Concepts

### Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

CTEs provide a way to define temporary result sets within a query, improving readability and reusability. They are defined using the `WITH` clause.

**Syntax**:
```sql
WITH cte_name AS (
  SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```

**Example**:
```sql
-- Calculate average order value by customer
WITH avg_order_value AS (
  SELECT 
    c.customer_id, 
    c.name, 
    AVG(o.total) AS avg_order
  FROM customers c
  JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
  GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name
)
SELECT name, avg_order
FROM avg_order_value
WHERE avg_order > 1000
ORDER BY avg_order DESC;
```

**Reasoning**: CTEs simplify complex queries by breaking them into modular, readable parts. They are particularly useful for intermediate calculations or reusable subqueries.

**Use Case**: Generating reports that require multiple steps of data processing, such as sales analytics.

---

### Recursive Queries

Recursive CTEs handle hierarchical or recursive data, such as organizational charts or tree structures, by referencing themselves.

**Syntax**:
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte_name AS (
  -- Base case
  SELECT column1 FROM table_name WHERE condition
  UNION
  -- Recursive case
  SELECT column1 FROM table_name t
  JOIN cte_name c ON t.parent_id = c.id
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```

**Example**:
```sql
-- Create employees table with hierarchy
CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  manager_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id)
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, name, manager_id) VALUES
  (1, 'CEO', NULL),
  (2, 'Manager A', 1),
  (3, 'Manager B', 1),
  (4, 'Employee A1', 2),
  (5, 'Employee B1', 3);

-- Find employee hierarchy
WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
  SELECT employee_id, name, manager_id, 0 AS level
  FROM employees
  WHERE manager_id IS NULL
  UNION
  SELECT e.employee_id, e.name, e.manager_id, h.level + 1
  FROM employees e
  JOIN employee_hierarchy h ON e.manager_id = h.employee_id
)
SELECT name, level
FROM employee_hierarchy
ORDER BY level;
```

**Reasoning**: Recursive CTEs traverse hierarchical data efficiently, avoiding complex joins or procedural code.

**Use Case**: Modeling organizational structures or category trees in e-commerce.

### Advanced Window Functions

Window functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row, offering advanced analytics like running totals, rankings, and moving averages.

**Key Functions**:
- `LAG`/`LEAD`: Access previous/next row values.
- `NTILE`: Divides rows into buckets.
- `CUME_DIST`: Calculates cumulative distribution.
- `FIRST_VALUE`/`LAST_VALUE`: Retrieves first/last value in a window.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Analyze sales trends with window functions
SELECT 
  product_id,
  sale_date,
  amount,
  LAG(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY sale_date) AS prev_sale,
  SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY sale_date) AS running_total,
  NTILE(4) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY amount) AS quartile
FROM sales
ORDER BY product_id, sale_date;
```

**Reasoning**: Window functions enable complex analytics without grouping, preserving row-level data for detailed insights.

**Use Case**: Tracking sales trends or customer behavior over time.

### Query Optimization Techniques

Optimizing queries improves performance for large datasets or high-traffic systems.

**Techniques**:
- **Use Indexes**: Index frequently queried columns.
- **Avoid SELECT *** : Specify only needed columns.
- **Use EXPLAIN**: Analyze query execution plans.
- **Denormalize Sparingly**: Balance normalization with performance.
- **Batch Operations**: Reduce round-trips with bulk inserts/updates.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Analyze query plan
EXPLAIN SELECT name, price 
FROM products 
WHERE category = 'Electronics' 
ORDER BY price;

-- Optimize with index
CREATE INDEX idx_category ON products(category);

-- Batch insert
INSERT INTO products (product_id, name, price, category)
VALUES 
  (100, 'Smart TV', 799.99, 'Electronics'),
  (101, 'Headphones', 199.99, 'Electronics');
```

**Reasoning**: `EXPLAIN` identifies bottlenecks, and indexes reduce lookup times. Batch operations minimize overhead.

**Use Case**: Optimizing queries for a high-traffic e-commerce platform.

---

### Partitioned Tables

Table partitioning divides large tables into smaller, manageable pieces based on a key (e.g., date or range), improving query performance and maintenance.

**Types**:
- **Range Partitioning**: Based on value ranges (e.g., dates).
- **List Partitioning**: Based on discrete values (e.g., regions).
- **Hash Partitioning**: Distributes rows using a hash function.

**Example (PostgreSQL)**:
```sql
-- Create partitioned table
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INT,
  order_date DATE,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2)
) PARTITION BY RANGE (order_date);

-- Create partitions
CREATE TABLE orders_2024 PARTITION OF orders
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2025-01-01');

CREATE TABLE orders_2025 PARTITION OF orders
FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-01-01') TO ('2026-01-01');

-- Query specific partition
SELECT * FROM orders_2024 WHERE amount > 100;
```

**Reasoning**: Partitioning reduces query scope, improving performance for large datasets.

**Use Case**: Managing historical order data in a data warehouse.

---

### Materialized Views

Materialized views store query results physically, unlike regular views, and can be refreshed periodically for performance.

**Example (PostgreSQL)**:
```sql
-- Create materialized view
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW top_products AS
SELECT product_id, name, SUM(quantity) AS total_sold
FROM orders
GROUP BY product_id, name
WITH DATA;

-- Refresh materialized view
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW top_products;

-- Query materialized view
SELECT * FROM top_products WHERE total_sold > 100;
```

**Reasoning**: Materialized views cache complex query results, reducing computation time for frequent queries.

**Use Case**: Generating cached reports for dashboards.

---

### Triggers

Triggers automatically execute actions (e.g., updates, inserts) when specific events occur on a table.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Create audit table
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
  log_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  table_name VARCHAR(50),
  action VARCHAR(50),
  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create trigger function (PostgreSQL)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_update()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO audit_log (table_name, action)
  VALUES ('products', 'UPDATE');
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Create trigger
CREATE TRIGGER product_update_trigger
AFTER UPDATE ON products
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION log_update();

-- Update to trigger action
UPDATE products SET price = price * 1.1 WHERE product_id = 1;
```

**Reasoning**: Triggers enforce business rules or log changes automatically, ensuring data consistency.

**Use Case**: Auditing changes to critical data like prices.

---

### Stored Procedures and Functions

Stored procedures and functions encapsulate complex logic in the database, improving modularity and security.

**Stored Procedure Example (PostgreSQL)**:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE update_stock(product_id INT, quantity INT)
LANGUAGE SQL
AS $$
  UPDATE products 
  SET stock = stock - quantity 
  WHERE product_id = $1 AND stock >= quantity;
  INSERT INTO orders (order_id, product_id, quantity)
  VALUES (NEXTVAL('order_seq'), $1, $2);
$$;

-- Call procedure
CALL update_stock(1, 5);
```

**Function Example**:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_total_sales(prod_id INT)
RETURNS DECIMAL AS $$
  SELECT SUM(quantity * price) 
  FROM orders o
  JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
  WHERE o.product_id = prod_id;
$$ LANGUAGE SQL;

-- Use function
SELECT get_total_sales(1);
```

**Reasoning**: Procedures and functions centralize logic, reducing application code and improving maintainability.

**Use Case**: Automating order processing or calculating sales metrics.

---

### Advanced Indexing Strategies

Advanced indexing includes partial indexes, expression indexes, and covering indexes to optimize specific queries.

**Example (PostgreSQL)**:
```sql
-- Partial index
CREATE INDEX idx_active_products ON products(category) WHERE stock > 0;

-- Expression index
CREATE INDEX idx_lower_name ON products(LOWER(name));

-- Covering index (includes columns for query)
CREATE INDEX idx_price_covering ON products(price) INCLUDE (name, stock);
```

**Reasoning**: Partial indexes reduce storage, expression indexes optimize case-insensitive searches, and covering indexes minimize table scans.

**Use Case**: Optimizing queries for filtered or transformed data.

---

### Handling JSON and Semi-Structured Data

Modern RDBMS support JSON for storing and querying semi-structured data.

**Example (PostgreSQL)**:
```sql
-- Create table with JSONB column
CREATE TABLE products (
  product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  details JSONB
);

-- Insert JSON data
INSERT INTO products (product_id, details) 
VALUES (1, '{"name": "Laptop", "specs": {"ram": "16GB", "cpu": "i7"}}');

-- Query JSON
SELECT details->'name' AS name
FROM products
WHERE details->'specs'->>'ram' = '16GB';
```

**Reasoning**: JSONB allows flexible schema design, enabling queries on nested data without predefined columns.

**Use Case**: Storing product attributes with varying structures.

---

### Concurrency Control and Locking

Concurrency control ensures data consistency in multi-user environments using locks or optimistic concurrency.

**Locking Example**:
```sql
-- Row-level lock for update
BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_id = 1 FOR UPDATE;
UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE product_id = 1;
COMMIT;
```

**Optimistic Locking Example**:
```sql
-- Add version column
ALTER TABLE products ADD version INT DEFAULT 1;

-- Update with version check
UPDATE products 
SET stock = stock - 1, version = version + 1
WHERE product_id = 1 AND version = 1;
```

**Reasoning**: Locks prevent conflicts, while optimistic locking reduces lock contention in high-concurrency systems.

**Use Case**: Managing inventory updates in a multi-user system.

---

### Database Security and Access Control

Security involves user roles, permissions, and protecting against SQL injection.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Create role
CREATE ROLE app_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'secure_password';

-- Grant permissions
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON products TO app_user;
GRANT SELECT ON orders TO app_user;

-- Revoke permissions
REVOKE INSERT ON products FROM app_user;

-- Parameterized query to prevent SQL injection
SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = ?; -- Use with application code
```

**Reasoning**: Role-based access control limits data exposure, and parameterized queries prevent injection attacks.

**Use Case**: Securing sensitive customer data in a database.

---

## Best Practices for Advanced SQL

1. **Optimize Indexes**: Regularly analyze and drop unused indexes to reduce maintenance overhead.
   ```sql
   -- Check index usage (PostgreSQL)
   SELECT * FROM pg_stat_user_indexes;
   ```
2. **Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE**: Diagnose query performance and identify bottlenecks.
   ```sql
   EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM products WHERE price > 500;
   ```
3. **Monitor Locks**: Detect and resolve deadlocks in high-concurrency systems.
   ```sql
   -- View locks (PostgreSQL)
   SELECT * FROM pg_locks;
   ```
4. **Partition Large Tables**: Use partitioning for tables exceeding millions of rows.
5. **Backup Regularly**: Use tools like `pg_dump` for PostgreSQL to ensure data recovery.
   ```sql
   pg_dump -U username dbname > backup.sql
   ```
6. **Avoid Overusing Subqueries**: Prefer CTEs or joins for better readability and performance.
7. **Secure Connections**: Use SSL/TLS for database connections in production.
8. **Test with Realistic Data**: Simulate production data volumes to validate query performance.

**Reasoning**: These practices ensure scalability, performance, and security in production environments.

**Use Case**: Managing enterprise-grade database systems.
