## Initial Screening Round

### Behavioral Questions

1. **Describe a time when you had to pivot a full-stack project due to changing requirements. How did you manage it?**

   **Answer**: On a dashboard project, the client shifted from a SQL to a NoSQL database mid-development. I evaluated MongoDB’s suitability, updated the Node.js backend to use Mongoose, and adjusted the React front-end for the new data structure. I communicated changes via a detailed changelog and conducted team training, ensuring a smooth pivot with minimal delays.

2. **Tell us about a time you optimized a full-stack application’s performance end-to-end.**

   **Answer**: In a real-time analytics app, slow API responses and UI rendering were issues. I optimized database queries with indexes, implemented Redis caching on the Node.js backend, and used React’s `useMemo` for costly computations. These changes reduced latency by 40%, and user feedback highlighted a smoother experience.

3. **Can you share an experience where you bridged a communication gap between front-end and back-end teams?**

   **Answer**: During an e-commerce project, misaligned API specs caused delays. I created a shared Swagger documentation, facilitated joint API design sessions, and prototyped endpoints with Postman. This aligned both teams, resulting in a 25% faster integration phase and improved collaboration.

4. **Describe a situation where you delivered a project under significant time pressure.**

   **Answer**: For a client demo, I built a booking app in two weeks. I prioritized MVP features (user auth, bookings) using Express and React, automated testing with Jest, and used a Kanban board to track progress. The demo succeeded, and iterative updates later added secondary features, teaching me effective prioritization.

5. **What’s an example of a time you introduced a new tool or process to improve development?**

   **Answer**: I introduced Docker to a team struggling with environment inconsistencies. I containerized the Node.js backend and PostgreSQL database, wrote a `docker-compose.yml` for local development, and trained the team. This reduced setup issues by 50% and streamlined CI/CD pipelines.

6. **Tell us about a time you handled a critical production issue in a full-stack app.**

   **Answer**: A payment API failed due to a misconfigured Stripe webhook. I used Winston logs to trace the issue, fixed the endpoint in Express, and deployed the update with zero downtime. I added automated tests to prevent recurrence, reinforcing the value of proactive monitoring.

### Situational Questions

7. **How would you respond if a stakeholder insists on a feature that compromises security?**

   **Answer**: I’d explain the security risks (e.g., storing passwords in plain text) and propose a secure alternative, like bcrypt hashing. I’d demo the solution’s benefits using OWASP guidelines and offer to implement it, balancing stakeholder needs with best practices.

8. **What would you do if a front-end component fails due to an unexpected API response?**

   **Answer**: I’d add error handling in the React component (e.g., fallback UI with `try/catch`), validate API responses with TypeScript or Joi, and log errors for debugging. I’d also coordinate with the backend team to standardize responses, ensuring robustness.

9. **How would you handle a database outage in a live application?**

   **Answer**: I’d implement a fallback (e.g., cached data from Redis), notify users with a friendly message, and monitor with tools like Datadog. I’d investigate using database logs, apply a fix (e.g., reconnect logic), and test before redeploying. Post-incident, I’d add failover mechanisms.

10. **What steps would you take if a new feature increases server load significantly?**

    **Answer**: I’d analyze the load with New Relic, optimize slow endpoints (e.g., caching, query optimization), and consider horizontal scaling with Kubernetes. I’d test the feature under load using JMeter and communicate trade-offs to stakeholders, ensuring scalability.

## Technical Round - Front-End

### HTML Questions

11. **What is the `<template>` element, and how is it used?**

    **Answer**: The `<template>` element holds inert HTML content that isn’t rendered until activated via JavaScript. Example:
    ```html
    <template id="my-template">
      <div>Content</div>
    </template>
    <script>
      const template = document.getElementById('my-template').content.cloneNode(true);
      document.body.appendChild(template);
    </script>
    ```
    It’s used for reusable UI fragments, like in Web Components.

12. **What is the purpose of the `rel` attribute in `<link>` tags?**

    **Answer**: The `rel` attribute specifies the relationship between the document and the linked resource (e.g., `stylesheet`, `icon`). Example:
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    ```
    It’s critical for defining resource purpose, like favicon or preload.

13. **How do you make HTML forms keyboard-accessible?**

    **Answer**: Ensure accessibility with:
    - `<label for="id">` for input association.
    - `tabindex` for custom elements.
    - ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-describedby`).
    Example: `<input id="email" aria-describedby="email-help">`. Test with keyboard navigation and screen readers.

14. **What is the difference between `<article>` and `<section>`?**

    **Answer**: `<article>` represents standalone content (e.g., a blog post), while `<section>` groups related content within a document. Use `<article>` for syndicated content and `<section>` for thematic blocks, like chapters.

15. **What is the `fetchpriority` attribute for resources?**

    **Answer**: The `fetchpriority` attribute hints at resource loading priority (`high`, `low`, `auto`). Example:
    ```html
    <img src="hero.jpg" fetchpriority="high">
    ```
    It optimizes critical resource loading, improving performance.

### CSS Questions

16. **What is the CSS `aspect-ratio` property?**

    **Answer**: `aspect-ratio` maintains an element’s width-to-height ratio. Example:
    ```css
    div { width: 100px; aspect-ratio: 16 / 9; }
    ```
    It’s useful for responsive images or videos, reducing layout shift.

17. **How do you create a CSS-only accordion?**

    **Answer**: Use `:checked` with radio inputs. Example:
    ```css
    input[type="radio"] { display: none; }
    input:checked + .content { display: block; }
    .content { display: none; }
    ```
    ```html
    <input type="radio" id="item1" name="accordion">
    <label for="item1">Toggle</label>
    <div class="content">Content</div>
    ```

18. **What is the difference between `transform` and `position` for animations?**

    **Answer**: `transform` (e.g., `translate`, `scale`) is GPU-accelerated, avoiding reflows, while `position` (e.g., `top`, `left`) triggers reflows, slowing performance. Use `transform` for smooth animations.

19. **What is the `content-visibility` property?**

    **Answer**: `content-visibility: auto` defers rendering off-screen elements, improving initial load. Example:
    ```css
    section { content-visibility: auto; contain-intrinsic-size: 1000px; }
    ```
    It optimizes long pages but requires size hints.

20. **How do you implement dark mode with CSS?**

    **Answer**: Use `prefers-color-scheme` and custom properties. Example:
    ```css
    :root { --bg: white; --text: black; }
    @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
      :root { --bg: black; --text: white; }
    }
    body { background: var(--bg); color: var(--text); }
    ```

### JavaScript Questions

21. **What is the difference between `Array.prototype.flat` and `Array.prototype.concat`?**

    **Answer**:
    - `flat`: Flattens nested arrays (e.g., `[1, [2, 3]].flat()` → `[1, 2, 3]`).
    - `concat`: Merges arrays without flattening (e.g., `[1].concat([2, 3])` → `[1, 2, 3]`).
    Use `flat` for nested arrays, `concat` for merging.

22. **What is a Proxy object in JavaScript?**

    **Answer**: A `Proxy` intercepts operations on an object (e.g., get, set). Example:
    ```javascript
    const target = { key: 1 };
    const proxy = new Proxy(target, {
      get: (obj, prop) => obj[prop] || 'Not found'
    });
    console.log(proxy.key); // 1
    console.log(proxy.unknown); // "Not found"
    ```
    It’s used for validation or logging.

23. **How do you throttle a function in JavaScript?**

    **Answer**:
    ```javascript
    function throttle(fn, delay) {
      let last = 0;
      return (...args) => {
        const now = Date.now();
        if (now - last >= delay) {
          last = now;
          fn(...args);
        }
      };
    }
    ```

24. **What is the purpose of `async` functions returning Promises?**

    **Answer**: `async` functions implicitly return Promises, enabling `await` for cleaner asynchronous code. Example:
    ```javascript
    async function getData() { return 'Data'; }
    getData().then(console.log); // "Data"
    ```

25. **What is the difference between `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN`?**

    **Answer**:
    - `null`: Intentional absence of value.
    - `undefined`: Variable not assigned.
    - `NaN`: Invalid numeric result (e.g., `parseInt('abc')`).
    Use `===` to check types accurately.

## Technical Round - Back-End

### Node.js Questions

26. **What is the `stream` module in Node.js, and when is it used?**

    **Answer**: The `stream` module handles large data efficiently by processing it in chunks. Example:
    ```javascript
    const fs = require('fs');
    fs.createReadStream('file.txt').pipe(fs.createWriteStream('copy.txt'));
    ```
    It’s used for file handling or network operations to reduce memory usage.

27. **How do you implement WebSockets in Node.js?**

    **Answer**: Use the `ws` library. Example:
    ```javascript
    const WebSocket = require('ws');
    const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });
    wss.on('connection', ws => {
      ws.on('message', msg => ws.send(`Echo: ${msg}`));
    });
    ```
    WebSockets enable real-time communication.

28. **What is the purpose of `module.exports` in Node.js?**

    **Answer**: `module.exports` defines what a module exposes. Example:
    ```javascript
    module.exports = { add: (a, b) => a + b };
    ```
    It allows modular code reuse across files.

29. **How do you handle memory leaks in Node.js?**

    **Answer**: Identify leaks with tools like `heapdump`, avoid global variables, and clean up event listeners. Example:
    ```javascript
    const server = http.createServer();
    server.on('request', () => {});
    server.close(() => server.removeAllListeners());
    ```

30. **What is the `child_process` module used for?**

    **Answer**: The `child_process` module spawns subprocesses for CPU-intensive tasks. Example:
    ```javascript
    const { exec } = require('child_process');
    exec('ls', (err, stdout) => console.log(stdout));
    ```
    It’s used for running shell commands or parallel tasks.

### Database Questions

31. **What is a composite key in SQL?**

    **Answer**: A composite key is a primary key with multiple columns to ensure uniqueness. Example:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE order_items (
      order_id INT,
      product_id INT,
      PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id)
    );
    ```

32. **How do you optimize MongoDB queries?**

    **Answer**: Optimize with:
    - Indexes: `db.collection.createIndex({ field: 1 })`.
    - Projection: `db.collection.find({}, { field: 1 })`.
    - Aggregation pipelines for complex queries.
    Avoid over-fetching data to improve performance.

33. **What is the difference between `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN`?**

    **Answer**:
    - `INNER JOIN`: Returns rows with matching values in both tables.
    - `LEFT JOIN`: Returns all rows from the left table, with nulls for non-matching right table rows.
    Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users INNER JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
    ```

34. **What is sharding in databases?**

    **Answer**: Sharding splits a database into smaller partitions (shards) across servers to improve scalability. Example: Shard users by region in MongoDB. It enhances performance but complicates queries.

35. **How do you prevent SQL injection?**

    **Answer**: Use parameterized queries or ORMs. Example with MySQL:
    ```javascript
    db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [userId], (err, results) => {});
    ```

## Framework-Specific Round

### React Questions

36. **What is the purpose of `React.Fragment`?**

    **Answer**: `React.Fragment` groups children without adding extra DOM nodes. Example:
    ```javascript
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        <h1>Title</h1>
        <p>Content</p>
      </React.Fragment>
    );
    ```

37. **How do you handle errors in React components?**

    **Answer**: Use error boundaries. Example:
    ```javascript
    class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
      state = { hasError: false };
      static getDerivedStateFromError() { return { hasError: true }; }
      render() {
        if (this.state.hasError) return <h1>Error</h1>;
        return this.props.children;
      }
    }
    ```

38. **What is the difference between client-side and server-side rendering in React?**

    **Answer**:
    - **Client-side**: Renders in the browser, slower initial load but dynamic.
    - **Server-side**: Renders on the server (e.g., Next.js), faster initial load, better SEO.
    Use SSR for content-heavy apps.

39. **How do you optimize React hooks performance?**

    **Answer**: Use `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and avoid unnecessary state updates. Example:
    ```javascript
    const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => compute(data), [data]);
    ```

40. **What is the `useImperativeHandle` hook?**

    **Answer**: `useImperativeHandle` customizes the instance value exposed by a ref. Example:
    ```javascript
    const MyComponent = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
      useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({ focus: () => inputRef.current.focus() }));
      return <input ref={inputRef} />;
    });
    ```

### Express.js Questions

41. **How do you implement file compression in Express.js?**

    const compression = require('compression');
    app.use(compression());
    ```

42. **What is route middleware in Express.js?**

    **Answer**: Route middleware applies to specific routes. Example:
    ```javascript
    const auth = (req, res, next) => {
      if (req.user) next();
      else res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
    };
    app.get('/protected', auth, (req, res) => res.send('Protected'));
    ```

43. **How do you handle file downloads in Express.js?**

    **Answer**: Use `res.download`. Example:
    ```javascript
    app.get('/download', (req, res) => {
      res.download('./file.pdf');
    });
    ```

44. **What is the purpose of `express.json` middleware?**

    **Answer**: `express.json` parses JSON request bodies. Example:
    ```javascript
    app.use(express.json());
    app.post('/data', (req, res) => res.json(req.body));
    ```

45. **How do you implement API versioning in Express.js?**

    **Answer**: Use route prefixes or headers. Example:
    ```javascript
    app.use('/api/v1', v1Router);
    app.use('/api/v2', v2Router);
    ```
