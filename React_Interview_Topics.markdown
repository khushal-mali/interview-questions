# Comprehensive List of React Interview Topics

Hereâ€™s a **comprehensive list of React interview topics**, organized from basic to advanced, to help you prepare systematically for React developer interviews:

---

## **1. React Basics**

* What is React and its core philosophy (component-based architecture)
* Virtual DOM vs Real DOM
* JSX syntax and how it works
* Components: Functional vs Class components
* Props vs State
* Controlled vs Uncontrolled components
* React lifecycle methods (Class components)
* One-way data flow
* Setting up a React project (Create React App, Vite)
* React.Fragment
* Prop drilling

---

## **2. React Hooks**

* `useState`: Managing state in functional components
* `useEffect`: Handling side effects
* `useContext`: Accessing context in functional components
* `useReducer`: Managing complex state logic
* `useCallback`: Memoizing functions
* `useMemo`: Memoizing computed values
* `useRef`: Accessing DOM elements and persisting values
* `useLayoutEffect` vs `useEffect`
* Custom Hooks: Creating and using reusable hooks
* Rules of Hooks (only call at top level, only in React components/custom hooks)

---

## **3. State Management**

* Local state with `useState` and `useReducer`
* Context API for global state
* External state management libraries (Redux, Zustand, Recoil)
* Redux: Actions, Reducers, Store, Middleware (e.g., Redux Thunk, Redux Saga)
* React Query for server-state management
* State lifting
* When to use Context vs Redux vs other libraries

---

## **4. Component Patterns**

* Higher-Order Components (HOCs)
* Render Props
* Compound Components
* Controlled Components
* Presentational vs Container Components
* Error Boundaries
* Lazy loading components with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`
* Portals for rendering outside the DOM hierarchy
* Memoization with `React.memo`

---

## **5. React Router**

* Setting up React Router (`react-router-dom`)
* Route configuration (`BrowserRouter`, `Route`, `Switch`, `Link`)
* Dynamic routing and URL parameters
* Nested routes
* Protected routes and authentication
* Programmatic navigation (`useNavigate`, `history.push`)
* Lazy loading routes
* Query parameters and search params

---

## **6. Performance Optimization**

* `React.memo` for preventing unnecessary re-renders
* Optimizing re-renders with `useCallback` and `useMemo`
* Code splitting with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`
* Avoiding unnecessary renders in lists (using `key` prop)
* React Profiler for performance debugging
* PureComponent vs Component
* Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Next.js
* Static Site Generation (SSG)
* Windowing/virtualization (e.g., `react-window`, `react-virtualized`)

---

## **7. Advanced React Concepts**

* Reconciliation process
* Fiber architecture
* Concurrent Rendering (React 18)
* Suspense for data fetching
* Server Components (React 18+)
* Transition API (`startTransition`, `useTransition`)
* Hydration in SSR
* Custom renderers
* React DevTools for debugging
* Strict Mode behavior

---

## **8. Styling in React**

* CSS Modules
* Styled-components
* Emotion
* Tailwind CSS in React
* Inline styles vs CSS-in-JS
* CSS-in-JS performance considerations
* Scoped styles vs global styles
* Handling responsive design

---

## **9. Testing in React**

* Unit testing with Jest and React Testing Library
* Testing Hooks with `@testing-library/react-hooks`
* Mocking APIs and async calls
* Snapshot testing
* Testing user interactions (`fireEvent`, `userEvent`)
* End-to-end testing with Cypress or Playwright
* Code coverage reports
* Testing custom hooks

---

## **10. Forms in React**

* Controlled vs Uncontrolled forms
* Form libraries (React Hook Form, Formik)
* Handling form validation
* Managing form state with `useState` or `useReducer`
* Dynamic forms (adding/removing fields)
* Handling file inputs
* Form submission and error handling

---

## **11. React with TypeScript**

* Typing components (props, state)
* Typing Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.)
* Generics in React components
* Typing Context API
* Event handling with TypeScript
* Using interfaces vs types
* Type inference in React
* Common TypeScript patterns in React

---

## **12. Security in React**

* Preventing XSS (Cross-site scripting)
* Sanitizing user inputs
* Securely handling API keys
* CORS in React apps
* Content Security Policy (CSP)
* Secure routing and authentication

---

## **13. React Ecosystem**

* Next.js for SSR/SSG
* Gatsby for static sites
* React Native for mobile development
* Integration with GraphQL (Apollo Client, URQL)
* State management libraries (Redux Toolkit, MobX)
* Data fetching libraries (React Query, SWR)
* Form libraries (React Hook Form, Formik)
* UI component libraries (Material-UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI)

---

## **14. Popular Interview Patterns**

* Build a todo list app
* Implement a counter with `useState`
* Create a custom Hook
* Debounce/throttle input handling
* Infinite scroll implementation
* Building a modal with Portals
* Handling form validation
* Context API for theme toggling
* Recursive components (e.g., nested comments)
* Optimizing a slow-rendering list
* Implementing drag-and-drop
* Polyfill for `useEffect` or `useState` (conceptual)

---

ðŸ”¥ **Pro tip:**
Interviewers typically focus on:
1. **Conceptual clarity**: Explain Reactâ€™s core concepts (e.g., Virtual DOM, reconciliation, Hooks).
2. **Practical coding**: Build small features (e.g., todo app, form with validation, custom Hook).
3. **Optimization**: Solve performance issues or debug re-rendering problems.
4. **Ecosystem knowledge**: Familiarity with tools like React Router, Redux, or Next.js.
