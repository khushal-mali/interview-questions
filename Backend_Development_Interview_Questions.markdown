# 100 Backend Development Interview Questions with Detailed Explanations

## Programming Fundamentals

1. **What is the difference between a process and a thread?**  
   **Explanation**: A process is an independent program in execution with its own memory space, while a thread is a lightweight unit of execution within a process, sharing the same memory. Processes are isolated, making them heavier but safer, whereas threads are faster but require careful synchronization to avoid race conditions. For example, in a web server, multiple threads may handle client requests within a single process.

2. **Explain the concept of recursion and its use cases.**  
   **Explanation**: Recursion occurs when a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller subproblems. It’s useful for tasks like traversing tree structures (e.g., binary trees) or solving problems like factorial calculation. However, it can lead to stack overflow for deep recursion, so tail recursion or iterative solutions may be preferred in production systems.

3. **What is a closure in programming, and how is it used?**  
   **Explanation**: A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope even when executed outside that scope. In JavaScript, for example, closures are used to create private variables or encapsulate functionality, such as in event handlers or callbacks. Example: A counter function that maintains its count variable across calls.

4. **What is the difference between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference?**  
   **Explanation**: In pass-by-value, a copy of the variable is passed to a function, so changes inside the function don’t affect the original. In pass-by-reference, a reference to the variable is passed, so changes affect the original. Java uses pass-by-value for primitives and pass-by-reference for objects, while Python uses pass-by-object-reference.

5. **What are higher-order functions?**  
   **Explanation**: Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions. They enable functional programming patterns, like map, filter, and reduce in JavaScript or Python. For example, `Array.map()` applies a function to each element of an array, abstracting iteration logic.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

6. **What is the time complexity of common operations in a hash table?**  
   **Explanation**: A hash table typically offers O(1) average-case time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups due to its key-value mapping and hashing function. However, in the worst case (e.g., hash collisions), it can degrade to O(n). Proper hash function design and collision resolution (e.g., chaining or open addressing) are critical.

7. **Explain how a binary search tree (BST) works.**  
   **Explanation**: A BST is a tree where each node has at most two children, and the left child’s value is less than the parent’s, while the right child’s is greater. It supports efficient searching, insertion, and deletion with O(log n) time complexity in balanced cases, but can degrade to O(n) if unbalanced. Self-balancing BSTs (e.g., AVL, Red-Black) mitigate this.

8. **What is a heap, and how is it used in priority queues?**  
   **Explanation**: A heap is a binary tree-based data structure where the parent node’s value is greater (max-heap) or smaller (min-heap) than its children. Priority queues use heaps to efficiently retrieve the highest/lowest priority element in O(1) time and insert/remove in O(log n). Example: Scheduling tasks in a system.

9. **What is the difference between a stack and a queue?**  
   **Explanation**: A stack follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO), like a pile of plates, used in scenarios like function call stacks. A queue follows First-In-First-Out (FIFO), like a line at a counter, used in task scheduling or message queues. Variations include double-ended queues (deques) and priority queues.

10. **How would you detect a cycle in a linked list?**  
    **Explanation**: Use Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare). Two pointers move at different speeds (one twice as fast). If they meet, a cycle exists. Time complexity is O(n), and space complexity is O(1). This is useful in detecting infinite loops in data structures.

## Databases

11. **What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?**  
    **Explanation**: SQL databases are relational, using structured tables and SQL for querying (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL). They enforce schemas and are good for complex queries. NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB) are non-relational, schema-less, and support diverse data types, ideal for scalability and unstructured data.

12. **What is database normalization, and why is it important?**  
    **Explanation**: Normalization organizes data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity by dividing tables into smaller units and linking them via keys. It follows rules (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) to ensure data consistency and efficient storage. Over-normalization can lead to complex queries, so balance is key.

13. **Explain the concept of database indexing.**  
    **Explanation**: An index is a data structure (e.g., B-tree) that improves query performance by allowing faster data retrieval. It’s like a book’s index, mapping keys to data locations. However, indexes increase storage and slow down write operations, so they’re used selectively on frequently queried columns.

14. **What are ACID properties in a database?**  
    **Explanation**: ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) ensures reliable database transactions. Atomicity ensures all-or-nothing execution; Consistency maintains data integrity; Isolation prevents transaction interference; Durability guarantees committed transactions persist. These are critical for financial or critical systems.

15. **What is a deadlock, and how can it be prevented?**  
    **Explanation**: A deadlock occurs when two or more transactions wait indefinitely for each other to release resources. Prevention includes using consistent resource acquisition order, timeouts, or deadlock detection algorithms. In databases, minimizing transaction duration and avoiding nested locks help.

## APIs and Web Services

16. **What is REST, and what are its key principles?**  
    **Explanation**: REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing web services. Key principles include statelessness, client-server separation, uniform interface (using HTTP methods like GET, POST), and resource-based URLs. REST APIs are scalable and widely used for web communication.

17. **What is the difference between REST and GraphQL?**  
    **Explanation**: REST uses fixed endpoints to return structured data, often leading to over- or under-fetching. GraphQL allows clients to request specific data via a single endpoint, reducing data transfer. REST is simpler for small APIs, while GraphQL excels in complex, flexible queries.

18. **Explain HTTP status codes and their categories.**  
    **Explanation**: HTTP status codes indicate the result of a request. Categories include: 1xx (Informational), 2xx (Success, e.g., 200 OK), 3xx (Redirection, e.g., 301 Moved Permanently), 4xx (Client Error, e.g., 404 Not Found), 5xx (Server Error, e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).

19. **What is the purpose of CORS?**  
    **Explanation**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security mechanism that allows or restricts resources requested from another domain. It uses HTTP headers (e.g., `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`) to define trusted origins, preventing unauthorized access while enabling legitimate cross-domain requests.

20. **What is an API rate limiter, and why is it used?**  
    **Explanation**: An API rate limiter restricts the number of requests a client can make in a given time to prevent abuse, ensure fair usage, and protect server resources. Techniques include token bucket or leaky bucket algorithms, often implemented at the server or gateway level.

## System Design

21. **What are the key components of a scalable web application?**  
    **Explanation**: A scalable web application includes a load balancer (e.g., NGINX), application servers, a database (SQL/NoSQL), caching (e.g., Redis), and message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ). Horizontal scaling, microservices, and CDN usage enhance scalability, while monitoring ensures performance.

22. **How would you design a URL shortening service like Bitly?**  
    **Explanation**: Key components include a unique ID generator (e.g., base62 encoding), a database to store URL mappings, and a REST API for creating/retrieving URLs. Use caching for frequent redirects, ensure collision-free IDs, and handle high traffic with load balancers and sharding.

23. **What is load balancing, and how does it work?**  
    **Explanation**: Load balancing distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to improve reliability and performance. Algorithms include round-robin, least connections, or IP hash. Hardware or software load balancers (e.g., AWS ELB) ensure no single server is overwhelmed.

24. **What is the CAP theorem, and how does it apply to databases?**  
    **Explanation**: The CAP theorem states that a distributed system can only guarantee two of three properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. For example, MongoDB prioritizes availability and partition tolerance (AP), while traditional SQL databases prioritize consistency and partition tolerance (CP).

25. **Explain microservices architecture and its benefits.**  
    **Explanation**: Microservices break an application into small, independent services communicating via APIs. Benefits include scalability, independent deployment, and technology diversity. Challenges include complexity in managing distributed systems and inter-service communication.

## Security

26. **What is SQL injection, and how can it be prevented?**  
    **Explanation**: SQL injection occurs when malicious SQL code is inserted into input fields, manipulating database queries. Prevention includes using prepared statements, parameterized queries, input validation, and ORM tools like SQLAlchemy to avoid direct query concatenation.

27. **What is the difference between authentication and authorization?**  
    **Explanation**: Authentication verifies a user’s identity (e.g., via username/password or OAuth). Authorization determines what a user can do (e.g., role-based access control). For example, a user may authenticate to access an app but lack authorization to delete data.

28. **What is OAuth, and how does it work?**  
    **Explanation**: OAuth is an authorization framework allowing third-party apps to access user data without sharing credentials. It uses tokens (access/refresh) issued by an authorization server after user consent. Example: Logging into a site using Google credentials.

29. **What is a CSRF attack, and how can it be mitigated?**  
    **Explanation**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tricks users into executing unwanted actions on a trusted site. Mitigation includes using CSRF tokens, validating the `Origin` header, and requiring re-authentication for sensitive actions.

30. **What is encryption, and how is it used in backend systems?**  
    **Explanation**: Encryption transforms data into an unreadable format to protect confidentiality. Symmetric encryption (e.g., AES) uses one key, while asymmetric (e.g., RSA) uses a public-private pair. Backend systems use encryption for data at rest (e.g., database) and in transit (e.g., HTTPS).

## Concurrency and Multithreading

31. **What is the difference between concurrency and parallelism?**  
    **Explanation**: Concurrency involves handling multiple tasks that make progress independently, often by interleaving execution (e.g., async/await). Parallelism executes tasks simultaneously on multiple cores. Concurrency improves responsiveness, while parallelism boosts performance.

32. **What is a race condition, and how can it be avoided?**  
    **Explanation**: A race condition occurs when multiple threads access shared resources concurrently, leading to unpredictable results. Avoidance techniques include locks (e.g., mutex), atomic operations, or thread-safe data structures. Example: Synchronizing access to a shared counter.

33. **What is the producer-consumer problem?**  
    **Explanation**: This is a classic concurrency problem where producers generate data and consumers process it, using a shared buffer. Synchronization (e.g., semaphores, monitors) ensures the buffer doesn’t overflow or underflow, maintaining thread safety.

34. **What is a semaphore, and how is it used?**  
    **Explanation**: A semaphore is a synchronization primitive that controls access to a shared resource using a counter. Binary semaphores act like locks, while counting semaphores allow multiple threads up to a limit. It’s used in scenarios like limiting database connections.

35. **Explain the concept of thread pools.**  
    **Explanation**: A thread pool manages a fixed number of reusable threads to execute tasks, reducing the overhead of thread creation. It’s used in web servers (e.g., Java’s ExecutorService) to handle multiple client requests efficiently.

## Networking

36. **What is the difference between TCP and UDP?**  
    **Explanation**: TCP is connection-oriented, ensuring reliable, ordered data delivery with error checking, suitable for web applications. UDP is connectionless, faster but unreliable, used for real-time applications like video streaming or gaming.

37. **What is DNS, and how does it work?**  
    **Explanation**: Domain Name System (DNS) translates domain names (e.g., google.com) to IP addresses. It involves resolvers, root servers, TLD servers, and authoritative servers. Caching at various levels improves performance but may cause propagation delays.

38. **What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?**  
    **Explanation**: HTTP is unencrypted, while HTTPS uses TLS/SSL to encrypt data, ensuring secure communication. HTTPS is critical for protecting sensitive data (e.g., passwords) and is now standard for web applications to prevent eavesdropping.

39. **What is a socket, and how is it used in backend development?**  
    **Explanation**: A socket is an endpoint for communication between two machines, used in protocols like TCP or UDP. In backend development, sockets enable real-time communication (e.g., WebSockets for chat apps) or server-client interactions.

40. **What is a CDN, and how does it improve performance?**  
    **Explanation**: A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers caching content closer to users. It reduces latency, improves load times, and handles traffic spikes. Example: Serving static assets like images or CSS from edge servers.

## Performance Optimization

41. **What is caching, and how does it improve performance?**  
    **Explanation**: Caching stores frequently accessed data in fast storage (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to reduce database or computation load. Types include in-memory, distributed, and browser caching. It’s critical for scaling web applications but requires cache invalidation strategies.

42. **What is lazy loading, and when is it used?**  
    **Explanation**: Lazy loading delays loading non-critical resources until needed, improving initial load times. In databases, it avoids fetching related data until accessed (e.g., ORM lazy loading). It’s used in web apps to optimize performance but may increase latency for later requests.

43. **What is database sharding, and why is it used?**  
    **Explanation**: Sharding splits a database into smaller, independent pieces (shards) distributed across servers to improve scalability and performance. Each shard handles a subset of data (e.g., by user ID). It’s used in large-scale systems but complicates queries and maintenance.

44. **What is connection pooling, and why is it important?**  
    **Explanation**: Connection pooling maintains a pool of reusable database connections to avoid the overhead of establishing new connections. It’s critical for high-traffic applications, reducing latency and resource usage. Example: HikariCP in Java.

45. **How would you optimize a slow API endpoint?**  
    **Explanation**: Steps include profiling to identify bottlenecks, optimizing database queries (e.g., indexing, avoiding N+1), caching responses, reducing payload size, and using asynchronous processing. Tools like New Relic or Prometheus help monitor performance.

## Testing and Debugging

46. **What is unit testing, and why is it important?**  
    **Explanation**: Unit testing verifies individual components (e.g., functions) in isolation. It ensures code correctness, facilitates refactoring, and catches bugs early. Frameworks like JUnit (Java) or pytest (Python) are commonly used in backend development.

47. **What is the difference between unit tests and integration tests?**  
    **Explanation**: Unit tests focus on isolated components, mocking dependencies, while integration tests verify interactions between components (e.g., API and database). Unit tests are faster and more focused, while integration tests ensure system-level correctness.

48. **What is mocking, and when is it used?**  
    **Explanation**: Mocking replaces real dependencies with simulated ones to isolate code during testing. It’s used in unit tests to avoid external dependencies (e.g., databases, APIs). Tools like Mockito (Java) or unittest.mock (Python) simplify mocking.

49. **What is debugging, and what tools do you use?**  
    **Explanation**: Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing code issues. Tools include IDE debuggers (e.g., IntelliJ, VS Code), logging frameworks (e.g., Log4j, SLF4J), and monitoring tools (e.g., Grafana). Breakpoints and stack traces help pinpoint issues.

50. **What is test-driven development (TDD)?**  
    **Explanation**: TDD is a methodology where tests are written before code. The cycle is: write a failing test, write code to pass it, and refactor. It ensures code quality, clear requirements, and maintainability but may slow initial development.

## Frameworks and Tools

51. **What is Spring Boot, and why is it popular?**  
    **Explanation**: Spring Boot is a Java framework that simplifies building production-ready applications with minimal configuration. It provides embedded servers, dependency injection, and auto-configuration. Its popularity stems from rapid development and integration with microservices.

52. **What is Django, and how does it support backend development?**  
    **Explanation**: Django is a Python web framework with an ORM, admin interface, and built-in security features (e.g., CSRF protection). It follows the DRY principle and accelerates development for database-driven applications like content management systems.

53. **What is Node.js, and how does it differ from traditional backend frameworks?**  
    **Explanation**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime for server-side development, using an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. Unlike traditional frameworks (e.g., Spring), it’s lightweight and excels in real-time applications like chat or streaming but may struggle with CPU-intensive tasks.

54. **What is the role of an ORM in backend development?**  
    **Explanation**: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool maps database tables to application objects, simplifying database interactions. Examples include Hibernate (Java) and SQLAlchemy (Python). ORMs reduce boilerplate code but may introduce performance overhead for complex queries.

55. **What is Docker, and how is it used in backend development?**  
    **Explanation**: Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications and dependencies into containers for consistent deployment. In backend development, it ensures environments (e.g., dev, prod) are identical, simplifies scaling, and integrates with orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

## Cloud and DevOps

56. **What is the difference between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS?**  
    **Explanation**: IaaS (e.g., AWS EC2) provides virtualized infrastructure, PaaS (e.g., Heroku) offers platforms for app development, and SaaS (e.g., Gmail) delivers software over the internet. Backend developers often use IaaS/PaaS for hosting and scaling applications.

57. **What is Kubernetes, and how does it help in backend deployment?**  
    **Explanation**: Kubernetes is an orchestration platform for managing containerized applications. It automates scaling, deployment, and load balancing. In backend development, it ensures high availability and fault tolerance for microservices across clusters.

58. **What is CI/CD, and why is it important?**  
    **Explanation**: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) automates code integration, testing, and deployment. CI ensures frequent code commits are tested, while CD deploys changes to production. Tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions improve development speed and reliability.

59. **What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?**  
    **Explanation**: IaC manages infrastructure using code (e.g., Terraform, AWS CloudFormation) instead of manual configuration. It enables reproducible, version-controlled environments, reducing errors and speeding up deployment in backend systems.

60. **What is serverless architecture, and when is it used?**  
    **Explanation**: Serverless architecture (e.g., AWS Lambda) allows developers to run code without managing servers, scaling automatically. It’s used for event-driven tasks (e.g., file processing, API triggers) but may have cold start latency and cost concerns for heavy workloads.

## Error Handling and Logging

61. **What is exception handling, and how is it implemented?**  
    **Explanation**: Exception handling manages runtime errors to prevent application crashes. In languages like Java, try-catch blocks handle exceptions, while Python uses try-except. Proper handling includes logging errors and providing user-friendly messages.

62. **What is the purpose of logging in backend systems?**  
    **Explanation**: Logging records application events (e.g., errors, transactions) for debugging, monitoring, and auditing. Structured logging (e.g., JSON format) with tools like ELK Stack or Logstash helps analyze issues in distributed systems.

63. **What is the difference between logging and monitoring?**  
    **Explanation**: Logging records detailed events for post-analysis, while monitoring tracks system health in real-time (e.g., CPU usage, request latency). Tools like Prometheus (monitoring) and Log4j (logging) complement each other for system observability.

64. **What is a circuit breaker pattern, and why is it used?**  
    **Explanation**: The circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures in distributed systems by halting requests to a failing service after a threshold. It improves resilience, allowing systems to fail gracefully. Libraries like Resilience4j implement this.

65. **What is retry logic, and how should it be implemented?**  
    **Explanation**: Retry logic automatically retries failed operations (e.g., API calls) with exponential backoff to handle transient failures. Implementation includes setting retry limits, delays, and logging to avoid overwhelming systems or hiding persistent issues.

## Scalability and Distributed Systems

66. **What is eventual consistency, and when is it acceptable?**  
    **Explanation**: Eventual consistency means that in distributed systems, data updates propagate over time, not instantly. It’s acceptable in systems prioritizing availability (e.g., social media feeds) but not in critical systems like banking, where strong consistency is needed.

67. **What is a distributed transaction, and why is it challenging?**  
    **Explanation**: A distributed transaction spans multiple systems (e.g., databases, services) and must maintain ACID properties. Challenges include network failures and coordination complexity. Solutions like two-phase commit or saga patterns address this.

68. **What is the role of a message queue in distributed systems?**  
    **Explanation**: Message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) decouple producers and consumers, enabling asynchronous communication. They ensure reliable message delivery, load balancing, and fault tolerance in distributed systems like microservices.

69. **What is sharding vs. replication in databases?**  
    **Explanation**: Sharding splits data across multiple servers for scalability, while replication copies data to multiple servers for redundancy and read scalability. Sharding improves write performance, while replication enhances availability and fault tolerance.

70. **What is the difference between horizontal and vertical scaling?**  
    **Explanation**: Horizontal scaling adds more servers to distribute load, improving fault tolerance and scalability. Vertical scaling increases a server’s resources (e.g., CPU, RAM). Horizontal is preferred for distributed systems, while vertical is simpler but limited by hardware.

## Authentication and Authorization

71. **What is JWT, and how is it used in authentication?**  
    **Explanation**: JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, self-contained token for secure data exchange. It consists of a header, payload, and signature. In authentication, servers issue JWTs after login, which clients include in requests to verify identity.

72. **What is the difference between session-based and token-based authentication?**  
    **Explanation**: Session-based authentication stores user state on the server (e.g., session ID in a cookie), while token-based (e.g., JWT) stores state client-side. Token-based is stateless and scalable but requires careful token management.

73. **What is role-based access control (RBAC)?**  
    **Explanation**: RBAC restricts access based on user roles (e.g., admin, user). Permissions are assigned to roles, not individuals, simplifying management. It’s implemented in backend systems to control access to resources like APIs or database records.

74. **What is OAuth 2.0’s authorization code flow?**  
    **Explanation**: The authorization code flow involves a client redirecting the user to an authorization server, which issues a code after user consent. The client exchanges the code for an access token. It’s secure for server-side apps accessing APIs.

75. **What is single sign-on (SSO)?**  
    **Explanation**: SSO allows users to authenticate once and access multiple systems without re-login. It uses protocols like SAML or OAuth, relying on a central identity provider (e.g., Okta). It’s common in enterprise systems for user convenience.

## Advanced Topics

76. **What is eventual consistency in NoSQL databases?**  
    **Explanation**: Eventual consistency allows temporary inconsistencies in distributed NoSQL databases (e.g., Cassandra) to prioritize availability. Updates propagate over time, suitable for non-critical applications like social media but not for financial systems.

77. **What is a saga pattern in microservices?**  
    **Explanation**: The saga pattern manages distributed transactions in microservices by breaking them into local transactions with compensating actions (rollbacks). It avoids locking, improving scalability, but requires careful error handling.

78. **What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous communication?**  
    **Explanation**: Synchronous communication (e.g., REST API calls) blocks until a response is received, suitable for quick, dependent operations. Asynchronous (e.g., message queues) allows independent processing, ideal for long-running or decoupled tasks.

79. **What is a service mesh, and how does it help?**  
    **Explanation**: A service mesh (e.g., Istio) manages communication between microservices, providing features like load balancing, service discovery, and observability. It simplifies complex networking in distributed systems, improving reliability and security.

80. **What is event sourcing, and when is it used?**  
    **Explanation**: Event sourcing stores application state as a sequence of events, allowing reconstruction of state by replaying them. It’s used in systems requiring audit trails or complex state management, like financial or e-commerce systems.

## Practical Coding Questions

81. **Write a function to reverse a string in Python.**  
    **Explanation**: A simple solution uses string slicing (`s[::-1]`), but iterating characters or using a two-pointer approach demonstrates understanding of algorithms. Time complexity is O(n), and space complexity depends on the approach (O(1) for in-place, O(n) for new string).

82. **Implement a REST API endpoint in Node.js to fetch user data.**  
    **Explanation**: Use Express.js to create a GET endpoint (e.g., `/users/:id`). Connect to a database (e.g., MongoDB) using an ORM like Mongoose, handle errors, and return JSON. Include input validation and proper HTTP status codes.

83. **Write a SQL query to find the top 5 employees by salary.**  
    **Explanation**: Use `SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 5;`. Ensure proper indexing on the salary column for performance. Handle edge cases like ties or empty tables with appropriate checks.

84. **Implement a rate limiter in Python.**  
    **Explanation**: Use a token bucket algorithm, storing timestamps and request counts in Redis or a dictionary. Check if requests exceed the limit within a time window, returning 429 if exceeded. Ensure thread safety for concurrent access.

85. **Write code to parse a JSON file and insert data into a database.**  
    **Explanation**: Use Python’s `json` module to parse the file and an ORM like SQLAlchemy to insert data. Include error handling for invalid JSON or database failures. Batch inserts improve performance for large datasets.

## Problem-Solving and Scenarios

86. **How would you handle a sudden spike in API traffic?**  
    **Explanation**: Implement rate limiting, caching, and load balancing. Use auto-scaling in cloud environments (e.g., AWS) to add servers dynamically. Monitor metrics with tools like Prometheus to identify bottlenecks and optimize slow endpoints.

87. **What steps would you take if a database query is slow?**  
    **Explanation**: Analyze the query with EXPLAIN (SQL) to identify inefficiencies. Add indexes, optimize joins, or denormalize data if needed. Consider caching results or sharding for large datasets. Profile the query in a test environment first.

88. **How would you secure a REST API?**  
    **Explanation**: Use HTTPS, JWT or OAuth for authentication, role-based authorization, input validation, and rate limiting. Protect against SQL injection, CSRF, and XSS. Regularly audit dependencies and monitor API usage for anomalies.

89. **How would you design a notification system?**  
    **Explanation**: Use a message queue (e.g., Kafka) for asynchronous delivery, a database to store notification data, and a service to handle delivery (e.g., email, push). Support multiple channels, retry failed deliveries, and ensure scalability with sharding or partitioning.

90. **What would you do if a backend service fails in production?**  
    **Explanation**: Check logs and monitoring tools to identify the issue. Roll back recent changes if needed, use circuit breakers to isolate failures, and notify stakeholders. Implement a post-mortem to analyze root causes and prevent recurrence.

## Miscellaneous

91. **What is the role of middleware in a backend framework?**  
    **Explanation**: Middleware intercepts requests/responses in frameworks like Express or Django, handling tasks like authentication, logging, or request parsing. It enables modular, reusable logic, improving maintainability and separation of concerns.

92. **What is a reverse proxy, and how does it differ from a forward proxy?**  
    **Explanation**: A reverse proxy forwards client requests to backend servers, providing load balancing and caching (e.g., NGINX). A forward proxy acts on behalf of clients to access external resources. Reverse proxies are server-side, while forward proxies are client-side.

93. **What is the difference between monolithic and microservices architectures?**  
    **Explanation**: Monolithic architectures combine all components into a single application, simplifying development but limiting scalability. Microservices split functionality into independent services, improving scalability but increasing complexity in deployment and communication.

94. **What is the purpose of API versioning?**  
    **Explanation**: API versioning prevents breaking changes from affecting clients by maintaining multiple API versions (e.g., `/v1/users`). Methods include URL paths, headers, or query parameters. It ensures backward compatibility but increases maintenance.

95. **What is a webhook, and how is it used?**  
    **Explanation**: A webhook is an HTTP callback triggered by an event, sending data to a specified URL. It’s used for real-time notifications, like updating a client when a payment is processed. Security includes verifying signatures to ensure authenticity.

96. **What is the difference between stateless and stateful applications?**  
    **Explanation**: Stateless applications (e.g., REST APIs) don’t retain client data between requests, improving scalability. Stateful applications maintain session data (e.g., WebSocket connections), requiring careful state management but enabling complex interactions.

97. **What is the role of a service discovery mechanism?**  
    **Explanation**: Service discovery (e.g., Consul, Eureka) helps microservices locate each other dynamically in distributed systems. It maintains a registry of service instances, enabling load balancing and fault tolerance in dynamic environments.

98. **What is the difference between a hotfix and a regular release?**  
    **Explanation**: A hotfix is a small, urgent update to fix critical issues in production, often deployed outside the regular release cycle. Regular releases include planned features and updates, following a structured CI/CD pipeline with testing.

99. **What is a blue-green deployment?**  
    **Explanation**: Blue-green deployment maintains two identical environments: one (blue) serves live traffic, while the other (green) is updated. After testing, traffic switches to green, minimizing downtime and enabling rollback if issues arise.

100. **What is the importance of code reviews in backend development?**  
     **Explanation**: Code reviews ensure code quality, catch bugs, and enforce standards. They improve collaboration, knowledge sharing, and maintainability. Tools like GitHub or GitLab facilitate reviews, but they require clear guidelines to avoid delays.
