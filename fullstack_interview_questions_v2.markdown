## Initial Screening Round

### Behavioral Questions

1. **Describe a time when you had to integrate a new technology into an existing full-stack project. How did you ensure a smooth transition?**

   **Answer**: In a project, I integrated GraphQL into a REST-based Node.js app. I studied GraphQL’s schema design, created a parallel endpoint to avoid disrupting existing APIs, and used Apollo Server for implementation. I collaborated with the front-end team to update React queries, tested thoroughly, and documented the changes. The transition improved query efficiency by 20%, reinforcing my adaptability.

2. **Tell us about a time you resolved a performance bottleneck in a full-stack application.**

   **Answer**: Users reported slow page loads in a dashboard app. Using Lighthouse, I identified unoptimized images, and on the back-end, slow MongoDB queries. I implemented lazy loading for images and added indexes to the database, reducing load times by 35%. This taught me the importance of end-to-end performance analysis.

3. **Can you share an experience where you mentored a teammate on a full-stack task?**

   **Answer**: I mentored a junior developer on integrating a React front-end with a Node.js API. I explained REST principles, guided them through Axios for API calls, and reviewed their code for error handling. Pair-programming sessions helped them understand async/await, boosting their confidence and improving team collaboration.

4. **Describe a situation where you had to prioritize certain features over others in a tight deadline.**

   **Answer**: On an e-commerce project, we faced a deadline with incomplete features. I prioritized the checkout flow over advanced filtering, as it was critical for launch. I used a Trello board to track tasks, communicated trade-offs to stakeholders, and delivered the core functionality on time, later adding filters in a follow-up sprint.

5. **What’s an example of a time you improved a process in a full-stack development workflow?**

   **Answer**: I noticed redundant manual testing in a CI/CD pipeline. I introduced automated tests with Jest for React and Mocha for Node.js, integrated with GitHub Actions. This reduced testing time by 40% and caught bugs earlier, improving deployment reliability and team efficiency.

### Situational Questions

6. **How would you handle a situation where a database schema change breaks the front-end?**

   **Answer**: I’d analyze the schema change’s impact using API logs and front-end error reports. I’d update the front-end to handle the new data structure, add fallback logic, and test with tools like Postman. I’d also propose versioning the API to prevent future breaks and communicate changes to the team.

7. **What would you do if a critical API endpoint fails in production?**

   **Answer**: I’d check logs (e.g., Winston in Node.js) to identify the error, reproduce it locally, and apply a fix (e.g., handling null responses). I’d deploy the fix with a rolling update, monitor with tools like New Relic, and add automated tests to prevent regression. Transparency with stakeholders is key.

8. **How would you approach a client requesting a feature that conflicts with best practices?**

   **Answer**: I’d explain the best practice (e.g., avoiding inline scripts for security) and its benefits, like improved maintainability. I’d propose an alternative, prototype it, and show performance metrics (e.g., Lighthouse scores). This ensures client needs are met while maintaining quality.

## Technical Round - Front-End

### HTML Questions

9. **What are HTML5 custom elements, and how are they implemented?**

   **Answer**: Custom elements extend HTML with user-defined tags, created using the Custom Elements API. Example:
   ```html
   <script>
     class MyElement extends HTMLElement {
       connectedCallback() {
         this.innerHTML = '<p>Hello, Custom Element!</p>';
       }
     }
     customElements.define('my-element', MyElement);
   </script>
   <my-element></my-element>
   ```
   They enable reusable, encapsulated components, often paired with frameworks.

10. **What is the purpose of the `<base>` tag?**

    **Answer**: The `<base>` tag sets a default URL or target for relative links in a document. Example:
    ```html
    <base href="https://example.com/">
    <a href="page.html">Link</a> <!-- Resolves to https://example.com/page.html -->
    ```
    It simplifies URL management but should be used cautiously to avoid confusion.

11. **How do you ensure HTML is SEO-friendly?**

    **Answer**: Ensure SEO with:
    - Semantic tags (`<header>`, `<article>`).
    - Meta tags (e.g., `<meta name="description" content="Site info">`).
    - Proper heading hierarchy (`<h1>` to `<h6>`).
    - Alt text for images.
    Example: `<img src="logo.png" alt="Company logo">` improves indexing.

12. **What is the `inert` attribute, and when is it used?**

    **Answer**: The `inert` attribute makes an element non-interactive, ignoring focus and events. Example:
    ```html
    <div inert>Non-interactive content</div>
    ```
    It’s used for modals or disabled sections, improving accessibility by preventing unintended interactions.

### CSS Questions

13. **What is the CSS `clip-path` property, and how is it used?**

    **Answer**: `clip-path` defines a clipping region for an element, shaping its visible area. Example:
    ```css
    div { clip-path: circle(50%); }
    ```
    It’s used for creative designs like circular images but may affect accessibility if not paired with proper ARIA roles.

14. **How do you create a CSS-only tooltip?**

    **Answer**: Use pseudo-elements and `:hover`. Example:
    ```css
    .tooltip {
      position: relative;
    }
    .tooltip:hover::after {
      content: attr(data-tooltip);
      position: absolute;
      background: black;
      color: white;
      padding: 5px;
    }
    ```
    ```html
    <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Info">Hover me</span>
    ```
    This is lightweight but limited compared to JavaScript tooltips.

15. **What is the difference between `vw`/`vh` and `%` units?**

    **Answer**:
    - `vw`/`vh`: Relative to viewport width/height (e.g., `10vw` is 10% of viewport width).
    - `%`: Relative to the parent element’s dimensions.
    Example: `width: 50vw` scales with the viewport; `width: 50%` scales with the parent.

16. **How do you handle CSS specificity conflicts?**

    **Answer**: Resolve conflicts by:
    - Using more specific selectors (e.g., `.class` over `element`).
    - Avoiding `!important` unless necessary.
    - Structuring CSS modularly with BEM.
    Example: `.parent .child` (0,0,2,0) overrides `.child` (0,0,1,0).

### JavaScript Questions

17. **What is the difference between `slice` and `splice` in JavaScript?**

    **Answer**:
    - `slice`: Returns a shallow copy of an array portion without modifying the original (e.g., `arr.slice(1, 3)`).
    - `splice`: Modifies the array by removing/adding elements (e.g., `arr.splice(1, 2, 'new')`).
    Example:
    ```javascript
    let arr = [1, 2, 3];
    console.log(arr.slice(1, 2)); // [2]
    arr.splice(1, 1); // arr = [1, 3]
    ```

18. **What is a WeakMap, and when is it useful?**

    **Answer**: A `WeakMap` is a collection where keys are objects, and entries are garbage-collected when keys are no longer referenced. Example:
    ```javascript
    let wm = new WeakMap();
    let obj = {};
    wm.set(obj, 'data');
    ```
    It’s useful for private data storage without memory leaks, unlike regular `Map`.

19. **How do you handle asynchronous errors in JavaScript?**

    **Answer**: Use `try/catch` with `async/await` or `.catch()` with Promises. Example:
    ```javascript
    async function fetchData() {
      try {
        const res = await fetch('api/data');
        if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Network error');
        return res.json();
      } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
      }
    }
    ```
    This ensures robust error handling for async operations.

20. **What is the purpose of `Object.freeze`?**

    **Answer**: `Object.freeze` makes an object immutable, preventing property additions, deletions, or modifications. Example:
    ```javascript
    const obj = Object.freeze({ key: 1 });
    obj.key = 2; // Fails silently
    ```
    It’s used for constants or protecting data integrity.

21. **What is the difference between `setTimeout` and `requestAnimationFrame`?**

    **Answer**:
    - `setTimeout`: Executes a function after a specified delay.
    - `requestAnimationFrame`: Executes before the next repaint, ideal for animations.
    Example:
    ```javascript
    requestAnimationFrame(() => console.log('Frame'));
    ```
    Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth UI updates.

## Technical Round - Back-End

### Node.js Questions

22. **What is the EventEmitter in Node.js, and how is it used?**

    **Answer**: `EventEmitter` enables event-driven programming by emitting and listening to events. Example:
    ```javascript
    const EventEmitter = require('events');
    const emitter = new EventEmitter();
    emitter.on('event', () => console.log('Triggered'));
    emitter.emit('event');
    ```
    It’s used for pub-sub patterns, like handling WebSocket messages.

23. **How do you handle file uploads in Express.js?**

    **Answer**: Use middleware like `multer` for file uploads. Example:
    ```javascript
    const multer = require('multer');
    const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });
    app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
      res.send('File uploaded');
    });
    ```
    It handles multipart form data securely.

24. **What is the purpose of `process.env` in Node.js?**

    **Answer**: `process.env` accesses environment variables for configuration (e.g., API keys). Example:
    ```javascript
    const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
    app.listen(port);
    ```
    Use `.env` files with `dotenv` for secure, environment-specific settings.

25. **How do you prevent callback hell in Node.js?**

    **Answer**: Avoid callback hell with:
    - Promises or `async/await`.
    - Modular code with separate functions.
    Example:
    ```javascript
    async function run() {
      const data = await asyncTask();
      return data;
    }
    ```
    This improves readability and maintainability.

26. **What is the role of the `http` module in Node.js?**

    **Answer**: The `http` module creates HTTP servers and clients. Example:
    ```javascript
    const http = require('http');
    const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
      res.end('Hello');
    });
    server.listen(3000);
    ```
    It’s the foundation for frameworks like Express.

### Database Questions

27. **What is database normalization, and why is it important?**

    **Answer**: Normalization organizes data to eliminate redundancy and ensure consistency, using normal forms (e.g., 1NF, 2NF). Example: Splitting a table with user and order data into separate `users` and `orders` tables. It reduces storage needs and prevents anomalies during updates.

28. **How do you handle transactions in SQL?**

    **Answer**: Use `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` to ensure atomicity. Example:
    ```sql
    BEGIN;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE user_id = 1;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE user_id = 2;
    COMMIT;
    ```
    Rollback on errors to maintain data integrity.

29. **What is a MongoDB index, and how does it improve performance?**

    **Answer**: A MongoDB index improves query performance by creating a data structure for fast lookups. Example:
    ```javascript
    db.collection.createIndex({ email: 1 });
    ```
    It speeds up queries like `db.collection.find({ email: 'user@example.com' })` but increases write time.

30. **What is the difference between a JOIN and a UNION in SQL?**

    **Answer**:
    - `JOIN`: Combines rows from multiple tables based on a condition (e.g., `INNER JOIN`).
    - `UNION`: Combines result sets of multiple queries, removing duplicates.
    Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT name FROM users JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
    SELECT name FROM users UNION SELECT name FROM admins;
    ```

31. **How do you secure a database?**

    **Answer**: Secure with:
    - Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
    - Role-based access control.
    - Encrypting sensitive data (e.g., passwords with bcrypt).
    - Regular backups.
    Example: Use `?` in MySQL: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?`.

## Framework-Specific Round

### React Questions

32. **What is the purpose of `useRef` in React?**

    **Answer**: `useRef` creates a mutable reference that persists across renders, used for DOM access or storing values without re-rendering. Example:
    ```javascript
    const inputRef = useRef();
    <input ref={inputRef} />;
    inputRef.current.focus();
    ```

33. **How do you implement lazy loading in React?**

    **Answer**: Use `React.lazy` and `Suspense`. Example:
    ```javascript
    const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./Component'));
    function App() {
      return (
        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
          <LazyComponent />
        </Suspense>
      );
    }
    ```
    It reduces initial bundle size.

34. **What is the difference between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`?**

    **Answer**:
    - `useEffect`: Runs after render, async, for side effects like API calls.
    - `useLayoutEffect`: Runs synchronously after DOM updates, before painting, for layout-related tasks.
    Use `useEffect` for most cases to avoid blocking the UI.

35. **How do you manage global state in React without external libraries?**

    **Answer**: Use the Context API with `useReducer`. Example:
    ```javascript
    const StateContext = React.createContext();
    const reducer = (state, action) => ({ ...state, ...action });
    function App() {
      const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, {});
      return (
        <StateContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>
          <Child />
        </StateContext.Provider>
      );
    }
    ```

### Express.js Questions

36. **How do you implement authentication in Express.js?**

    **Answer**: Use JWT with `jsonwebtoken`. Example:
    ```javascript
    const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
    app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
      const token = jwt.sign({ userId: 1 }, 'secret');
      res.json({ token });
    });
    app.get('/protected', (req, res) => {
      const token = req.headers.authorization;
      jwt.verify(token, 'secret', (err, decoded) => {
        if (err) return res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
        res.send('Protected data');
      });
    });
    ```

37. **What is the purpose of `express.static`?**

    **Answer**: `express.static` serves static files like images or CSS. Example:
    ```javascript
    app.use(express.static('public'));
    ```
    Accessing `/image.jpg` serves `public/image.jpg`. It’s efficient for static assets.

38. **How do you handle CORS in Express.js?**

    **Answer**: Use the `cors` middleware. Example:
    ```javascript
    const cors = require('cors');
    app.use(cors({ origin: 'http://example.com' }));
    ```
    This allows cross-origin requests from specified domains.

## Advanced Technical Round

### System Design and Optimization Questions

39. **How do you design a RESTful API for a blogging platform?**

    **Answer**: Design with:
    - **Endpoints**: `GET /posts`, `POST /posts`, `GET /posts/:id`, etc.
    - **Resources**: Posts, users, comments.
    - **Authentication**: JWT for user actions.
    - **Database**: Relational (e.g., PostgreSQL) for structured data.
    - **Caching**: Redis for frequent queries.
    Example: `GET /posts?userId=1` retrieves user-specific posts.

40. **How do you optimize a Node.js application for high traffic?**

    **Answer**: Optimize with:
    - **Clustering**: Use `cluster` module for multi-core scaling.
    - **Load Balancing**: NGINX or AWS ELB.
    - **Caching**: Redis for API responses.
    - **Async Operations**: Avoid blocking with `async/await`.
    Example: Use `pm2` for process management and clustering.

41. **What is the difference between horizontal and vertical scaling?**

    **Answer**:
    - **Horizontal**: Add more servers (e.g., via Kubernetes).
    - **Vertical**: Increase server resources (e.g., more CPU).
    Horizontal scaling is more flexible for distributed systems but requires load balancing.

42. **How do you handle rate limiting in an API?**

    **Answer**: Use `express-rate-limit` or Redis-based solutions. Example:
    ```javascript
    const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
    app.use(rateLimit({ windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, max: 100 }));
    ```
    This limits requests per IP, preventing abuse.

43. **What is eventual consistency in distributed databases?**

    **Answer**: Eventual consistency ensures that, given enough time, all nodes in a distributed database (e.g., MongoDB) converge to the same state. It prioritizes availability over immediate consistency, suitable for high-traffic apps like social media but requires careful conflict resolution.

### Coding Questions

44. **Write an Express endpoint to paginate a list of users.**

    **Answer**:
    ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    const users = [{ id: 1, name: 'John' }, { id: 2, name: 'Jane' }];
    app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
      const page = parseInt(req.query.page) || 1;
      const limit = parseInt(req.query.limit) || 10;
      const start = (page - 1) * limit;
      const paginated = users.slice(start, start + limit);
      res.json({ users: paginated, total: users.length });
    });
    app.listen(3000);
    ```

45. **Write a function to find the longest common prefix in an array of strings.**

    **Answer**:
    ```javascript
    function longestCommonPrefix(strs) {
      if (!strs.length) return '';
      let prefix = strs[0];
      for (let i = 1; i < strs.length; i++) {
        while (strs[i].indexOf(prefix) !== 0) {
          prefix = prefix.slice(0, -1);
          if (!prefix) return '';
        }
      }
      return prefix;
    }
    console.log(longestCommonPrefix(['flower', 'flow', 'flight'])); // "fl"
    ```

46. **Write a SQL query to find the top 5 users with the most orders.**

    **Answer**:
    ```sql
    SELECT u.id, u.name, COUNT(o.id) as order_count
    FROM users u
    JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
    GROUP BY u.id, u.name
    ORDER BY order_count DESC
    LIMIT 5;
    ```
