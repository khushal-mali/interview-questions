## Introduction to SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized language used to interact with relational databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data in a database. SQL is widely used in applications for tasks like data analysis, reporting, and backend development.

**Key Features**:
- **Declarative**: You specify what data you want, not how to retrieve it.
- **Portable**: Works across RDBMS like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.
- **Versatile**: Handles data manipulation, schema definition, and access control.

**Use Case**: Managing customer data in an e-commerce database.

---

## Database Basics

A **database** is an organized collection of data, typically stored in tables. Each table contains rows (records) and columns (attributes). An RDBMS manages databases, ensuring data integrity and efficient querying.

**Key Terms**:
- **Table**: A collection of rows and columns, like a spreadsheet.
- **Row**: A single record in a table (e.g., one customerâ€™s details).
- **Column**: A field that stores a specific attribute (e.g., customer name).
- **Schema**: The structure of the database, defining tables and relationships.
- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each row in a table.
- **Foreign Key**: A column that links to a primary key in another table.

**Use Case**: Storing product inventory in a retail database.

## Beginner SQL Concepts

### Data Types

SQL data types define the kind of data a column can store. Common types include:
- **Numeric**:
  - `INT`: Integer (e.g., 42).
  - `DECIMAL(p,s)`: Fixed-point number (e.g., 10.99, where `p` is precision, `s` is scale).
- **String**:
  - `VARCHAR(n)`: Variable-length string (e.g., "John", max length `n`).
  - `CHAR(n)`: Fixed-length string (e.g., "ABC  ", padded to length `n`).
- **Date/Time**:
  - `DATE`: Date (e.g., 2025-08-25).
  - `TIMESTAMP`: Date and time (e.g., 2025-08-25 14:30:00).
- **Boolean**: `BOOLEAN` (e.g., TRUE/FALSE, supported in PostgreSQL).
- **Others**: `TEXT` (long text), `BLOB` (binary data).

**Example**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  birth_date DATE,
  is_active BOOLEAN
);
```

**Reasoning**: Choosing appropriate data types ensures efficient storage and querying.

**Use Case**: Defining columns for a user profile table.

---

### Creating and Managing Databases

Databases are created and managed using SQL commands.

**Key Commands**:
- `CREATE DATABASE`: Creates a new database.
- `USE`: Selects a database to work with.
- `DROP DATABASE`: Deletes a database.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Create a database
CREATE DATABASE shop;

-- Select the database
USE shop;

-- Delete the database (use with caution)
DROP DATABASE shop;
```

**Reasoning**: These commands set up the environment for storing and managing data.

**Use Case**: Setting up a database for an online store.

---

### Creating and Modifying Tables

Tables store data in a structured format. Use `CREATE TABLE` to define a table and `ALTER TABLE` to modify it.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE products (
  product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  price DECIMAL(10,2),
  stock INT
);

-- Add a new column
ALTER TABLE products ADD category VARCHAR(50);

-- Modify a column
ALTER TABLE products MODIFY COLUMN name VARCHAR(150);

-- Drop a column
ALTER TABLE products DROP COLUMN category;
```

**Reasoning**: `CREATE TABLE` defines the schema, while `ALTER TABLE` allows schema evolution without data loss.

**Use Case**: Designing a product catalog table.

---

### Inserting Data

Use `INSERT INTO` to add rows to a table.

**Syntax**:
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);
```

**Example**:
```sql
-- Single row
INSERT INTO products (product_id, name, price, stock) 
VALUES (1, 'Laptop', 999.99, 10);

-- Multiple rows
INSERT INTO products (product_id, name, price, stock) 
VALUES 
  (2, 'Phone', 499.99, 20),
  (3, 'Tablet', 299.99, 15);
```

**Reasoning**: `INSERT INTO` populates tables with data, supporting single or bulk insertions.

**Use Case**: Adding new products to an inventory.

---

### Querying Data with SELECT

The `SELECT` statement retrieves data from one or more tables.

**Syntax**:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
```

**Example**:
```sql
-- Select specific columns
SELECT name, price FROM products;

-- Select all columns
SELECT * FROM products;
```

**Reasoning**: `SELECT` is the core of data retrieval, allowing flexible column selection.

**Use Case**: Displaying product names and prices in a report.

---

### Filtering with WHERE

The `WHERE` clause filters rows based on conditions.

**Operators**:
- Comparison: `=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Logical: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
- Pattern: `LIKE` (e.g., `'%phone%'`)
- Range: `BETWEEN`
- List: `IN`

**Example**:
```sql
-- Filter by price
SELECT name, price FROM products WHERE price > 500;

-- Filter with multiple conditions
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price BETWEEN 200 AND 1000 AND stock > 0;

-- Pattern matching
SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%phone%';
```

**Reasoning**: `WHERE` narrows down results, improving query precision and performance.

**Use Case**: Finding products within a price range.

---

### Sorting with ORDER BY

The `ORDER BY` clause sorts results in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Sort by price ascending
SELECT name, price FROM products ORDER BY price ASC;

-- Sort by multiple columns
SELECT name, price, stock FROM products ORDER BY price DESC, stock ASC;
```

**Reasoning**: Sorting organizes data for better readability and analysis.

**Use Case**: Displaying products from cheapest to most expensive.

---

### Limiting Results with LIMIT

The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows returned. Often used with `OFFSET` for pagination.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Get top 5 products
SELECT name, price FROM products ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Pagination (second page, 5 rows per page)
SELECT name, price FROM products ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5;
```

**Reasoning**: `LIMIT` improves performance and supports pagination in applications.

**Use Case**: Showing a paginated product list on a website.

---

### Basic Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions compute values over multiple rows:
- `COUNT`: Counts rows.
- `SUM`: Sums numeric values.
- `AVG`: Calculates average.
- `MIN`/`MAX`: Finds minimum/maximum values.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Count products
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_products FROM products;

-- Average price
SELECT AVG(price) AS avg_price FROM products;

-- Total stock by category
SELECT category, SUM(stock) AS total_stock 
FROM products 
GROUP BY category;
```

**Reasoning**: Aggregates summarize data for reporting and analytics.

**Use Case**: Calculating total inventory or average product price.

---

## Intermediate SQL Concepts

### Joins

Joins combine data from multiple tables based on related columns.

**Types**:
- **INNER JOIN**: Matches rows from both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN**: Includes all rows from the left table, with NULLs for non-matching right table rows.
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Includes all rows from the right table, with NULLs for non-matching left table rows.
- **FULL JOIN**: Includes all rows from both tables, with NULLs for non-matches.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Create related table
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  product_id INT,
  quantity INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
);

-- INNER JOIN
SELECT p.name, o.quantity 
FROM products p 
INNER JOIN orders o ON p.product_id = o.product_id;

-- LEFT JOIN
SELECT p.name, o.quantity 
FROM products p 
LEFT JOIN orders o ON p.product_id = o.product_id;
```

**Reasoning**: Joins enable relational data retrieval, combining related information across tables.

**Use Case**: Retrieving order details with product names.

---

### Group By and Having

`GROUP BY` groups rows by a column for aggregation, and `HAVING` filters grouped results.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Group by category and count products
SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS product_count 
FROM products 
GROUP BY category;

-- Filter groups with HAVING
SELECT category, AVG(price) AS avg_price 
FROM products 
GROUP BY category 
HAVING AVG(price) > 500;
```

**Reasoning**: `GROUP BY` organizes data for aggregation, and `HAVING` refines results based on aggregate conditions.

**Use Case**: Analyzing average prices by product category.

---

### Subqueries

A subquery is a query nested within another query, often used in `WHERE` or `SELECT`.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Find products above average price
SELECT name, price 
FROM products 
WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products);

-- Subquery in SELECT
SELECT name, 
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders o WHERE o.product_id = p.product_id) AS order_count 
FROM products p;
```

**Reasoning**: Subqueries enable complex filtering and calculations within a single query.

**Use Case**: Identifying high-priced products or counting related records.

---

### Indexes

Indexes improve query performance by allowing faster data retrieval.

**Types**:
- **Single-column index**: On one column.
- **Composite index**: On multiple columns.
- **Unique index**: Enforces uniqueness.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Create an index
CREATE INDEX idx_product_name ON products(name);

-- Create a composite index
CREATE INDEX idx_product_category_price ON products(category, price);

-- Drop an index
DROP INDEX idx_product_name ON products;
```

**Reasoning**: Indexes speed up `SELECT` and `WHERE` queries but may slow down `INSERT`/`UPDATE` due to index maintenance.

**Use Case**: Optimizing searches on frequently queried columns.

---

### Constraints

Constraints enforce data integrity:
- **PRIMARY KEY**: Ensures unique, non-null values.
- **FOREIGN KEY**: Links tables, enforcing referential integrity.
- **NOT NULL**: Requires a value.
- **UNIQUE**: Ensures unique values.
- **CHECK**: Enforces a condition.

**Example**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  age INT CHECK (age >= 18)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);
```

**Reasoning**: Constraints maintain data consistency and prevent invalid data.

**Use Case**: Ensuring valid customer emails and order relationships.

---

### Updating and Deleting Data

Use `UPDATE` to modify rows and `DELETE` to remove rows.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Update product price
UPDATE products 
SET price = price * 1.1 
WHERE category = 'Electronics';

-- Delete out-of-stock products
DELETE FROM products 
WHERE stock = 0;
```

**Reasoning**: `UPDATE` and `DELETE` allow dynamic data management, with `WHERE` ensuring precision.

**Use Case**: Adjusting prices or removing discontinued products.

---

### Views

A view is a virtual table based on a query, simplifying complex queries or restricting data access.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Create a view
CREATE VIEW expensive_products AS
SELECT name, price 
FROM products 
WHERE price > 500;

-- Query the view
SELECT * FROM expensive_products;

-- Drop the view
DROP VIEW expensive_products;
```

**Reasoning**: Views simplify queries and enhance security by limiting data exposure.

**Use Case**: Providing a simplified interface for reporting.

---

### Transactions

Transactions ensure atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) for multiple operations.

**Commands**:
- `BEGIN`/`START TRANSACTION`: Starts a transaction.
- `COMMIT`: Saves changes.
- `ROLLBACK`: Undoes changes.

**Example**:
```sql
BEGIN;

UPDATE products 
SET stock = stock - 1 
WHERE product_id = 1;

INSERT INTO orders (order_id, product_id, quantity) 
VALUES (100, 1, 1);

-- Check if stock is sufficient
SELECT stock FROM products WHERE product_id = 1;

-- Commit or rollback
COMMIT;
-- ROLLBACK;
```

**Reasoning**: Transactions ensure data consistency during complex operations like order processing.

**Use Case**: Safely updating inventory and orders.

---

### String and Date Functions

SQL provides functions to manipulate strings and dates.

**String Functions**:
- `CONCAT`: Combines strings.
- `UPPER`/`LOWER`: Changes case.
- `SUBSTRING`: Extracts part of a string.

**Date Functions**:
- `NOW()`: Current timestamp.
- `DATEADD` (SQL Server) / `INTERVAL` (PostgreSQL): Adds time.
- `DATEDIFF`: Calculates time difference.

**Example**:
```sql
-- String manipulation
SELECT CONCAT(name, ' - ', category) AS product_info 
FROM products;

-- Date manipulation
SELECT name, DATEADD(day, 7, created_at) AS expiry_date 
FROM products;
```

**Reasoning**: Functions simplify data formatting and calculations.

**Use Case**: Formatting product names or calculating expiration dates.

---

### Window Functions

Window functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row, without grouping.

**Common Functions**:
- `ROW_NUMBER()`: Assigns a unique number to each row.
- `RANK()`: Assigns ranks, with ties sharing the same rank.
- `SUM() OVER`: Calculates a running total.

**Example**:
```sql
-- Rank products by price within each category
SELECT 
  name, 
  price, 
  category,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY price DESC) AS price_rank
FROM products;

-- Running total of stock
SELECT 
  name, 
  stock,
  SUM(stock) OVER (ORDER BY product_id) AS running_stock
FROM products;
```

**Reasoning**: Window functions enable advanced analytics without aggregating rows, preserving row-level data.

**Use Case**: Ranking products or calculating cumulative totals.

---

## Best Practices and Tips

1. **Use Descriptive Names**: Name tables and columns clearly (e.g., `customer_id` instead of `id`).
2. **Normalize Data**: Avoid redundancy with proper table relationships.
3. **Index Strategically**: Index frequently queried columns, but avoid over-indexing.
4. **Write Readable Queries**: Use consistent formatting and comments for clarity.
   ```sql
   -- Get high-value orders
   SELECT c.name, o.quantity 
   FROM customers c 
   JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id 
   WHERE o.quantity > 10;
   ```
5. **Use Transactions for Critical Operations**: Ensure data integrity during updates.
6. **Optimize Queries**: Avoid `SELECT *` in production; specify needed columns.
7. **Secure Data**: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
   ```sql
   -- Safe query with parameters (syntax varies by RDBMS)
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?;
   ```
8. **Test Queries**: Use tools like SQL Fiddle or DB Fiddle to test queries.

**Reasoning**: These practices improve maintainability, performance, and security.

**Use Case**: Building robust, scalable database applications.
