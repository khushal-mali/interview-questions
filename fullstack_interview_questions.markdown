## Initial Screening Round

### Behavioral Questions

1. **Describe a time when you successfully integrated front-end and back-end components for a project. What challenges did you face?**

   **Answer**: In a recent e-commerce project, I integrated a React front-end with a Node.js/Express back-end to create a dynamic product listing. The challenge was syncing API data with the UI state. I used Redux for state management and implemented error handling for API failures. Regular testing with Postman ensured smooth integration, resulting in a seamless user experience and a 15% increase in page load speed.

2. **Tell us about a situation where you had to debug a critical issue in a production environment. How did you resolve it?**

   **Answer**: In a live application, users reported failed API requests due to a database connection issue. I used logging in Node.js to trace the error to a misconfigured MongoDB URI. I updated the environment variables, tested locally, and deployed the fix with zero downtime using a rolling update. This experience emphasized the importance of robust logging and environment management.

3. **Can you share an experience where you collaborated with a cross-functional team to meet a project deadline?**

   **Answer**: On a booking system project, I worked with designers, back-end developers, and QA engineers to deliver on time. I coordinated API specs using Swagger, ensured the React UI matched Figma designs, and conducted joint debugging sessions. Clear communication via Slack and daily stand-ups helped us meet the deadline, delivering a secure, user-friendly system.

### Situational Questions

4. **How would you handle a situation where the front-end and back-end teams disagree on API design?**

   **Answer**: I’d facilitate a meeting to align on requirements, focusing on user needs and technical constraints. I’d propose a clear API contract using tools like OpenAPI, prototype the solution, and test it with both teams. For example, if the front-end needs a specific data format, I’d suggest a middleware to transform back-end responses, ensuring compatibility and collaboration.

5. **What would you do if a client reports slow performance in a full-stack application you built?**

   **Answer**: I’d analyze performance using tools like Lighthouse for the front-end and New Relic for the back-end. If the issue is database-related, I’d check for unoptimized queries using indexes or caching (e.g., Redis). For front-end issues, I’d implement lazy loading or code splitting. I’d communicate findings to the client, propose fixes, and test improvements to ensure optimal performance.

## Technical Round - Front-End

### HTML Questions

6. **What is the purpose of the `<picture>` element in HTML5?**

   **Answer**: The `<picture>` element allows responsive image selection, offering multiple sources via `<source>` tags based on media queries or formats (e.g., WebP). Example:
   ```html
   <picture>
     <source media="(max-width: 600px)" srcset="small.jpg">
     <img src="default.jpg" alt="Image">
   </picture>
   ```
   It improves performance by serving optimized images for different devices.

7. **How do you ensure HTML forms are accessible?**

   **Answer**: Ensure accessibility by:
   - Using semantic tags like `<label for="id">`.
   - Adding ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-required="true"`).
   - Ensuring keyboard navigability.
   Example: `<input id="name" aria-required="true"> <label for="name">Name</label>`. Test with screen readers like JAWS to confirm compliance with WCAG.

8. **What is the role of the `aria-label` attribute?**

   **Answer**: The `aria-label` attribute provides a text description for elements lacking visible text, aiding screen readers. Example: `<button aria-label="Close dialog">X</button>` ensures assistive technologies describe the button’s purpose. It’s critical for accessibility in non-textual UI elements.

### CSS Questions

9. **What is the CSS `currentColor` keyword, and how is it used?**

   **Answer**: `currentColor` inherits the element’s `color` property value for other properties like `border` or `background`. Example:
   ```css
   div { color: blue; border: 1px solid currentColor; }
   ```
   The border will be blue. It’s useful for consistent theming and reducing code duplication.

10. **How do you implement a responsive grid layout using CSS Grid?**

    **Answer**: Use CSS Grid with media queries for responsiveness. Example:
    ```css
    .grid {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
      gap: 20px;
    }
    @media (max-width: 600px) {
      .grid { grid-template-columns: 1fr; }
    }
    ```
    This creates a flexible grid that adjusts columns based on screen size.

11. **What is the difference between `position: sticky` and `position: fixed`?**

    **Answer**: 
    - `sticky`: Stays within its parent container, sticking to a position (e.g., `top: 0`) during scrolling until the parent scrolls out.
    - `fixed`: Stays relative to the viewport, unaffected by parent scrolling.
    Example: `position: sticky; top: 0;` for a sticky header.

### JavaScript Questions

12. **What is the difference between `Promise.all` and `Promise.race`?**

    **Answer**:
    - `Promise.all`: Resolves when all promises resolve, returning an array of results, or rejects on any failure.
    - `Promise.race`: Resolves or rejects as soon as one promise settles.
    Example:
    ```javascript
    Promise.all([promise1, promise2]).then(results => console.log(results));
    Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(result => console.log(result));
    ```
    Use `Promise.all` for parallel tasks, `Promise.race` for the fastest response.

13. **How does JavaScript’s event loop work?**

    **Answer**: The event loop manages asynchronous operations by processing the call stack, task queue, and microtask queue. Synchronous code executes first, then microtasks (e.g., Promises), followed by tasks (e.g., `setTimeout`). Example:
    ```javascript
    console.log('Start');
    setTimeout(() => console.log('Timeout'), 0);
    Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('Promise'));
    console.log('End');
    ```
    Output: `Start`, `End`, `Promise`, `Timeout`. This ensures non-blocking behavior.

14. **What is the purpose of `Object.defineProperty`?**

    **Answer**: `Object.defineProperty` defines or modifies a property on an object, controlling its behavior (e.g., writable, enumerable). Example:
    ```javascript
    const obj = {};
    Object.defineProperty(obj, 'key', { value: 42, writable: false });
    obj.key = 100; // Fails, key remains 42
    ```
    It’s used for data encapsulation or creating read-only properties.

## Technical Round - Back-End

### Node.js Questions

15. **What is middleware in Express.js, and how is it used?**

    **Answer**: Middleware functions process requests in Express.js, running between the request and response. They can modify requests, handle authentication, or log data. Example:
    ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    app.use((req, res, next) => {
      console.log('Request received');
      next();
    });
    ```
    Middleware is chained with `next()` to pass control to the next function.

16. **How do you handle errors in a Node.js application?**

    **Answer**: Handle errors with:
    - Try-catch for synchronous code.
    - Error-first callbacks or Promises for asynchronous code.
    - Express error middleware: `app.use((err, req, res, next) => res.status(500).send('Error'));`.
    Example:
    ```javascript
    app.get('/', async (req, res, next) => {
      try {
        await someAsyncFunction();
      } catch (err) {
        next(err);
      }
    });
    ```
    Centralized error handling improves reliability.

17. **What is the purpose of the Node.js `cluster` module?**

    **Answer**: The `cluster` module enables multi-core processing by forking worker processes, improving performance for CPU-intensive tasks. Example:
    ```javascript
    const cluster = require('cluster');
    if (cluster.isMaster) {
      cluster.fork(); // Create worker
    } else {
      // Worker code
    }
    ```
    It’s used to scale Node.js apps across CPU cores.

### Database Questions

18. **What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?**

    **Answer**:
    - **SQL**: Structured, relational databases (e.g., MySQL) with fixed schemas, ideal for complex queries and transactions.
    - **NoSQL**: Flexible, non-relational databases (e.g., MongoDB) with dynamic schemas, suited for scalability and unstructured data.
    Example: Use SQL for financial apps, NoSQL for real-time analytics.

19. **How do you optimize a slow SQL query?**

    **Answer**: Optimize by:
    - Adding indexes on frequently queried columns.
    - Avoiding `SELECT *`, selecting only needed columns.
    - Using `EXPLAIN` to analyze query execution.
    - Implementing caching with Redis.
    Example: `CREATE INDEX idx_user_id ON users(id);` speeds up lookups.

20. **What is an ORM, and how does it benefit development?**

    **Answer**: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool like Sequelize or Mongoose maps database tables to JavaScript objects, simplifying queries. Benefits include faster development, reduced boilerplate, and easier maintenance. Example:
    ```javascript
    const User = sequelize.define('User', { name: DataTypes.STRING });
    await User.findAll();
    ```
    ORMs abstract SQL complexity but may add overhead for complex queries.

## Framework-Specific Round

### React Questions

21. **What is the significance of `useMemo` in React?**

    **Answer**: `useMemo` memoizes expensive computations, preventing recalculation on re-renders unless dependencies change. Example:
    ```javascript
    const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => heavyComputation(data), [data]);
    ```
    It optimizes performance for computationally intensive tasks.

22. **How do you handle form validation in React?**

    **Answer**: Use controlled components with state and libraries like Formik or React Hook Form. Example with `useState`:
    ```javascript
    const [form, setForm] = useState({ email: '' });
    const handleSubmit = () => {
      if (!form.email.includes('@')) alert('Invalid email');
    };
    ```
    Libraries provide built-in validation and error handling.

23. **What is server-side rendering (SSR) in React, and why use it?**

    **Answer**: SSR renders React components on the server, sending HTML to the client. It improves SEO and initial load time. Use frameworks like Next.js. Example:
    ```javascript
    export async function getServerSideProps() {
      const data = await fetchData();
      return { props: { data } };
    }
    ```
    SSR enhances performance for content-heavy apps.

### Express.js Questions

24. **How do you secure an Express.js API?**

    **Answer**: Secure an API by:
    - Using HTTPS with SSL/TLS.
    - Implementing JWT for authentication.
    - Validating inputs with `express-validator`.
    - Adding rate limiting with `express-rate-limit`.
    Example:
    ```javascript
    const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
    app.use(rateLimit({ windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, max: 100 }));
    ```

25. **What is the role of `express.Router`?**

    **Answer**: `express.Router` creates modular route handlers, organizing routes into separate files. Example:
    ```javascript
    const router = express.Router();
    router.get('/users', (req, res) => res.json({ users: [] }));
    app.use('/api', router);
    ```
    It improves code maintainability and scalability.

### System Design and Optimization Questions

26. **How do you design a scalable full-stack application?**

    **Answer**: Design with:
    - **Microservices**: Split functionality into independent services.
    - **Load Balancing**: Use NGINX or AWS ELB for traffic distribution.
    - **Caching**: Implement Redis for frequent queries.
    - **Database Scaling**: Use sharding or replication.
    Example: A booking app with separate services for users and payments, connected via REST APIs.

27. **How do you optimize API response times?**

    **Answer**: Optimize by:
    - Caching responses with Redis.
    - Using efficient database queries with indexes.
    - Compressing responses with `compression` middleware.
    - Implementing pagination for large datasets.
    Example: `app.use(compression());` in Express reduces response size.

28. **What is GraphQL, and how does it differ from REST?**

    **Answer**: GraphQL is a query language allowing clients to request specific data, reducing over- or under-fetching. REST uses fixed endpoints returning predefined data. Example:
    ```graphql
    query { user(id: 1) { name } }
    ```
    GraphQL offers flexibility; REST is simpler for smaller apps.

### Coding Questions

29. **Write a function to implement a simple REST API endpoint with Express.**

    **Answer**:
    ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    app.use(express.json());
    let users = [{ id: 1, name: 'John' }];
    app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => res.json(users));
    app.post('/api/users', (req, res) => {
      const user = { id: users.length + 1, name: req.body.name };
      users.push(user);
      res.status(201).json(user);
    });
    app.listen(3000);
    ```
    This creates GET and POST endpoints for a user resource.

30. **Write a function to merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array.**

    **Answer**:
    ```javascript
    function mergeSortedArrays(arr1, arr2) {
      const merged = [];
      let i = 0, j = 0;
      while (i < arr1.length && j < arr2.length) {
        if (arr1[i] <= arr2[j]) {
          merged.push(arr1[i++]);
        } else {
          merged.push(arr2[j++]);
        }
      }
      return merged.concat(arr1.slice(i)).concat(arr2.slice(j));
    }
    console.log(mergeSortedArrays([1, 3], [2, 4])); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
    ```
    This merges arrays efficiently in O(n) time.
